[Lecture 8 - Concurrency control](Lecture%208%20-%20Concurrency%20control.pdf).
The objective of this chapter is to **allow the database multiple concurrent access** while keeping #consistency.
## 8.1 Scheduling Introduction
Let's start with an example: we have the two following queries and the **constraint on the database that** $A = B$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231124103919.png)
There are *different schedules that will give different outputs*, depending on the order in which we execute the transactions.![](Pasted%20image%2020231124104328.png)
- Schedule C reaches consistency but this is a lucky guess. For example, Schedule D does not lead to consistency.
### 8.1.1 Good schedule
$\to$ We want #schedules that are **good** *regardless of*:
- *Initial state*
- *Transaction semantics*
*Example* $Sc=r1(A)w1(A)r2(A)w2(A)r1(B)w1(B)r2(B)w2(B)$

Let's see if we can **define equivalence rules** to *shuffles the steps of the procedure whilst maintaining the data consistency*.![](Pasted%20image%2020231124105319.png)
### 8.1.2 Transaction game
In order to do that, we can do the #transaction-game:![](Pasted%20image%2020231124105748.png)
Here, it is #serialisable, this **means that it is possible to perform transitions to have a serial procedure**.
For example, Schedule D is **not serialisable** because *no movements are possible*.![](Pasted%20image%2020231124105934.png)As a matter of fact, T2 must precede T1 in any equivalent schedule.
## 8.2 Concepts
#Transaction: sequence of $r_{i}(x), w_{i}(x)$ actions 
#Conflicting-actions: $r1(A) w2(A) | w1(A) w2(A) | r1(A) w2(A)$
	Pair of operations where at least one of the operations is a write.
	For example, `r1(A)` and `w2(A)` do not conflict because the read operation does not modify the data, but `w1(A)` and `w2(A)` conflict because they are both write operations on the same data item.
#Schedule: represents chronological order in which actions are executed 
#Serial-schedule: **no interleaving of actions or transactions**, each transaction is executed in its entirety before the next one begins.

![](Pasted%20image%2020231125135617.png)
- Here we can *assume that it is equivalent to either* $r_{1}(A)w_{2}(A)$ or $w_{2}(A)r_{1}(A)$
- This is a **low level synchronisation mechanism**
- This assumption is called - #atomic-actions


$S_{1}, S_{2}$ are #conflict-equivalent schedules *if* $S_{1}$ *can be transformed into* $S_{2}$ by a series of swaps on *non-conflicting actions*.

A #Schedule is #conflict-serialisable if it is #conflict-equivalent to some #Serial-schedule.
### Precedence graph P(S)
![](Pasted%20image%2020231124111043.png)
In this example, the schedule is **not serialisable because there is a cycle**.
	- There are lines from T3 to all Ti because w3(A) comes before all actions on A from all Ti
	- There is a line from T2 to T1  because w2(C) comes before the r1(C)
	- There is a line from T2 to T4  because w2(A) comes before the r4(A)
	- There is a line from T1 to T2 because r1(A) comes before w2(A)

Indeed, if there is a #cycle in the #PS (precedence graph), the schedule $S$ is not #serialisable.
## 8.3 Enforce serialisable schedules
### Option 1
- Run system
- Recording precedence graph P(S)
- At the end of the day, check for P(S) cycles and declare if execution was good!
### Option 2
- Prevent P(S) cycles from occurring by using a scheduler.

## 8.4 Locking protocol
Two new actions are defined:
- #lock (exclusive): $l_{i}(A)$ - *lock the access to the data $A$ for the transaction $i$.*
- #unlock: $u_{i}(A)$ - *unlock the access to the data $A$ for the transaction $i$*.
These actions will help the scheduler that will be able to look at the **lock table**.
### Rule 1 - Well-formed transactions
#Well-formed-transactions must **maintain**:
- **Consistency** of the database. The *locks acquired and released during a transaction* should be such that the *overall integrity and consistency of the database are preserved*. #consistency 
- **Isolation**: concurrent transactions *do not interfere with each other by acquiring conflicting locks*. #isolation
	- For *example*, <font color="#7f7f7f">if one transaction has acquired a lock on a certain data item, another transaction should not be allowed to acquire a conflicting lock on the same data item until the first transaction has released its lock.</font>
- **Atomicity**: the transaction is treated as a single indivisible unit of work. #atomicity 
	- For *example*,<font color="#7f7f7f"> if a transaction acquires locks on multiple data items, it should release all those locks together when the transaction is committed or roll back all the locks if the transaction is aborted.</font>
$$Ti: … li(A) … pi(A) … ui(A) \dots$$
### Rule 2 - Legal scheduler
![](Pasted%20image%2020231125121046.png)
A **transaction can not lock an item while another transaction locked the data**, you have to wait until the data is unlocked to access it.

Examples: Here only the 3rd schedule is legal.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231125130510.png)Indeed, S1 is not legal as 2 locks B that is already locked. 
S2 is not legal as B has not been unlocked by 2 before 3 locks B.

$\to$ If we **apply the two rules to our schedule**, we obtain:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231125130708.png)
### Rule 3 - Two phase locking for transactions #2PL
This rule concerns **two phase locking** #2PL  for transactions and ensures that, at any point in time during the execution of transactions, *the system is in a state that could arise if transactions were executed in some serial order*.
1. **Growing Phase (Locking Phase):**
    - In this phase, a *transaction is allowed to acquire as many locks as needed but cannot release any locks*.
    - Once a transaction releases a lock (either voluntarily or due to completion), it cannot acquire any new locks.
2. **Shrinking Phase (Unlocking Phase):**
    - After a transaction releases its first lock, it enters the shrinking phase.
    - In this phase, the *transaction is not allowed to acquire any new locks but can release the locks it currently holds*.
    - Once a transaction releases a lock in the shrinking phase, it cannot acquire any new locks.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231125134715.png)

When applied to the schedule, this **leads to a delay of the lock of the B data.**
![](Pasted%20image%2020231125135059.png)

If we exchange T1 and T2, we can have:![](Pasted%20image%2020231125135308.png) Indeed, #2PL can lead to **deadlocks**.
#### 2PL subset of Serialisable
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201092442.png)
#2PL are subset of serialisable, it is **correct but too strict**. The objective now is  to allow more concurrency without having problems, because #2PL leads to #deadlocks and is counter productive at a certain point.

Here is an example of schedule that is #serialisable but not #2PL.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201092933.png)
It is **not 2PL** because the *lock by T1 for y must occur after w2(y)*, so the *unlock by T1 for x must occur after this point* (and before w1(x)). Thus, w3(x) cannot occur under 2PL where shown in S1 because T1 holds the x lock at that point

But it is well **serialisable** because the #PS is $T_{2}\to T_{1}\to T_{3}$.

There are more examples [here](7.-Logging-and-recovery.pdf#page=53).
## 8.5 Improving concurrency control
As shown earlier, #2PL is correct but not the most performant because it may lead to deadlocks and thus diminish the concurrency.
To **allow more concurrency control**, we can use:
- #shared-locks
- #multiple-granularity
- Inserts, deletes and phantoms
- ...
### 8.5.1 Shared locks
So far we have the following schedule:![](Pasted%20image%2020231201093456.png)Instead, we will use #shared-lock **ls** and **us**:![](Pasted%20image%2020231201093538.png)The following actions:
- $l-t_{i}(A)$: lock $A$ in $t$ mode ($t$ is $S$ or $X$) (*shared* or *exclusive*)
- $u-t_{i}(A)$: unlock $t$ mode ($t$ is $S$ or $X$)

The $S$ is for #shared-lock, it *allows a transaction to read* a data item **without the ability to modify it**. Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same data item simultaneously.

The $X$ is for #exclusive-lock, it grants exclusive access to a data item, preventing any other transactions from acquiring either shared or exclusive locks on the same item.
**On the short hand: $u_{i}(A)$ unlocks whatever modes $T_{i}$ has locked $A$.**
#### Rule 1 - Well formed transaction
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201093825.png)
The transaction that read and write the same object have 2 options:
	**OPTION 1**: Request an exclusive lock![](Pasted%20image%2020231201094001.png)
	**OPTION 2**: Upgrade (for example if need to read but don't know if will write)![](Pasted%20image%2020231201094041.png)We can *think of $l-X_{1}(A)$* as a **second lock on A** or a **Drop S, get X lock**.

As we see, it is thus possible now to lock in share mode and re-lock in exclusive mode right after.
#### Rule 2 - Legal scheduler
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201094533.png)
We talk about the #compatibility matrix:![](Pasted%20image%2020231201094604.png)Transactions holding either a #shared-lock or an #exclusive-lock **cannot coexist with a transaction holding an exclusive lock**. This is because exclusive locks require exclusive access to the data item, and allowing multiple transactions to hold exclusive locks simultaneously would violate the principle of exclusive access.

While a transaction holding a #shared-lock **can coexist with another transaction holding a shared lock**.
#### Rule 3 - 2PL transactions
There is no change except for upgrades:
1. If upgrade gets more locks $\to$ then no change
2. If upgrade releases read (shared) lock $\to$ can be allowed in growing  phase
### 8.5.2 Lock types beyond S/X examples
#### Increment lock
**Atomic increment action** is represented by $$ IN_{i}(A) = \{Read(A);A\leftarrow A+k;Write(A)\}$$We can see that $IN_{i}(A),IN_{j}(A)$ **do not conflict!**
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201095046.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201095302.png) Their #compatibility matrix.

- **Motivation:** Increment locks are *used to control access to increment operations on numerical values in a database*. When multiple transactions attempt to increment the same value simultaneously, conflicts can arise, leading to incorrect results and potential data inconsistencies.
- **Example:** Consider a scenario where multiple users are updating the inventory count of a product simultaneously. Without increment locks, the final inventory count might be incorrect if transactions overlap.
#### Update lock
There is a problem for update because we reach a **deadlock**.![](Pasted%20image%2020231201095535.png)
A solution: if $T_{i}$ wants to read $A$ and **knows it may later want to write** $A$, it requests **update lock** (not a shared!).![](Pasted%20image%2020231201095649.png)
$\to$ Note that the object A can be locked in different modes at the same time as long as the locks are compatible. **To grant a lock in mode t, mode t must be compatible with all currently held locks on objects**. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020231201100710.png)

- **Motivation:** Update locks are *used to prevent a common concurrency issue known as the "lost update" problem*. This occurs when *multiple transactions read a value*, *perform some computation, and then update the value*. Without proper locking, one transaction's update may overwrite the changes made by another transaction.
- **Example:** Two users read the current stock of an item, perform calculations, and attempt to update the stock simultaneously. Without update locks, one user's update might overwrite the changes made by the other user.
#### Multi-granular lock
- **Motivation:** Multi-granular locks *allow transactions to lock various levels of granularity*, such as entire tables, rows, or even specific fields within a row. This flexibility *enables a balance between data consistency and system performance*.
- **Example:** In a sales database, a transaction might need to update information about a specific product while another transaction updates customer information. Multi-granular locks allow each transaction to lock only the relevant portions of the data to avoid unnecessary contention.
