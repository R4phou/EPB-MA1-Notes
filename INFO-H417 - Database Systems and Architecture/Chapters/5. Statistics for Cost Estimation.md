## 5.1 Statistical information for cost estimation
- $n_{r}$ : number of **tuples** in a *relation r*. 
- $b_{r}$ : number of **blocks containing tuples of r**.
- $l_{r}$ : **size** of a **tuple** of r.
- $f_{r}$ : **blocking factor of r** — i.e., the *number of tuples of r that fit into one block*. 
- $V(A, r)$ : **number of distinct values that appear in r for attribute A** $\leftrightarrow$ same as the size of $∏_{A}(r)$ (a projection)
- *If tuples of r are stored together physically in a file*, then:$$b_{r} = \lceil{\frac{n_{r}}{f_{r}}\rceil}$$
## 5.2 Histograms
Histograms allows to have **a better understanding of the distribution of the attributes of a relation**. There are two types of #histogram:
- #equi-width histograms : you assemble the values with the **same intervals** (see picture just below), the frequency will thus vary.
- #equi-depth histograms: assemble the intervals to have the **same frequency** per interval. *Break up range such that each range has the same number of tuples*.

The following #histogram is an #equi-width histogram on attribute *age* of relation *person*.

**Many databases also stores $n$ most-frequent values** and their counts. An #histogram is thus built on the remaining values only.

Histograms and other statistics are usually computed based on a random sample (not on the entire database!).

Note that when it comes to statistics, they very often become **out of date**. 
- To fix this, some database require a **analyse (vacuum)** command to be executed to update statistics. 
- The others automatically recompute statistics.
	- For example, when a number of tuples in a relation changes by some percentage.

## 5.4 Estimations on different queries
### 5.4.1 Selection size estimation
#selection
$\sigma_{A=V}(r)$
- $n_{r}/V(A,r)$: **number of records that will satisfy the selection**
- Equality condition on a key attribute (if $v$ is a primary key): *size estimation c = 1*

$\sigma_{A \leq V}(r)$
- Let $c$ denote the *estimated number of tuples satisfying the condition*
- If $min(A,r)$ and $max(A,r)$ are available in catalog
	- $c=0$ if $v < min(A,r)$
	- $c = n_{r} \frac{v-min(A,r)}{max(A,r)-min(A,r)}$
	- If histograms available, can refine above estimate
	- In absence of statistical information $c$ is assumed to be $n_{r}/2$ 
#### Complex selections
The **selectivity** of a condition $\theta_i$ is the probability that a tuple in the relation $r$ satisfies $\theta_{i}$. If $s_{i}$ is *the number of satisfying tuples in $r$*, the *selectivity* of $\theta_{i}$ is given by ${s_{i}}/{n_{r}}$.

#conjonction: $\sigma_{\theta_{1}∧\theta_{2}\dots∧\theta_{n}}(r)$
*Assuming independence* (that all conditions does not overlaps), the estimate of tuple in the result is$$n_{r} \frac{s_{1}\cdot s_{2} \cdot \dots s_{n}}{n_{r}^n}$$ #disjonction: $\sigma_{\theta_{1}∨\theta_{2}\dots∨\theta_{n}}(r)$
The estimated number of tuples:$$n_{r}\cdot\left( 1-\left( 1-\frac{s_{1}}{n_{r}} \right)\cdot \left( 1-\frac{s_{2}}{n_{r}} \right)\cdot \dots \cdot\left( 1-\frac{s_{n}}{n_{r}} \right) \right)$$
#negation: $\sigma_{¬\theta} (r)$
The estimated number of tuples $$n_{r}-size(\sigma_{\theta}(r))$$
### 5.4.2 Joins size estimation
In the following example:![](Pasted%20image%2020231224082158.png)If we make the following #join query:$$student ⨝ takes$$ And the #catalog information for this join example are the following![](Pasted%20image%2020231224082323.png)
#cartesian-product $r \times s$ contains $n_{r}\cdot n_{s}$ tuples, each occupies $s_{r}+s_{s}$ bytes$$c(r\times s) = s_{r}+s_{s}$$If $R \cap S = \phi$
$\to r \bowtie s$ is the same as $n_{r} \times n_{s}$.

If $R \cap S$ **is a key for $R$** 
$\to$ *A tuple of s will join with at most one tuple from* $r$. Therefore, the number of tuples in $r \bowtie s$ is no greater than the number of tuples in $s$.

If $R \cap S$ **is a foreign key** in $S$ **referencing** $R$
$\to$ the number of tuples in $r \bowtie s$ is exactly the same as the number of tuples in $s$.
	For the example query, ID in *takes* is a **foreign key** referencing $student$, hence, the result has exactly $n_{takes}$ tuples, which is 10000.

If $R \cap S = \{A\}$ is **not a key** to $R$ or $S$. 
$\to$ If *we assume that every tuple $t$ in $R$ produces tuples in $R \bowtie S$*, the number of tuples in $R \bowtie S$ is estimated to be $$\frac{n_{r} *n_{s}}{V(A,s)}$$
$\to$ If the reverse is true, the estimate will be$$\frac{n_{r} *n_{s}}{V(A,r)}$$
$\to$ The lower of these two estimates is probably the more accurate one.

It is more than possible to improve this thanks to the #histogram if they are available. We could then use a similar formula as above for each cell of the histograms on the two relations.

Example:
	Compute the size of estimates for the *example query* **without using information about foreign keys**.
	- $V(ID, takes) = 2500$
	- $V(ID, student) = 5000$
	- The two estimates are 
		- $5000 * 10000/2500 = 20000$ 
		- $5000 * 10000/5000 = 10000$
	- We choose the lowest estimate, which in this case, is the same as our earlier computation using foreign keys.
