- Then developing a new extension, in C, re-using Postgres internals as much as possible
## 3.1 Datatypes and non-decoration
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128155912.png)
To execute a query, Postgres needs to know the data types of the columns. 
Postgres is also #non-decorated, it will read the value *'something'* to determine it's data #type.

When a new #type is created, or it is not possible to see it from the literal value, we decorate it with a **prefix that is the name of the data type** of the value. (here **date** and **interval**).

## 3.2 Catalog
The database has some type of **catalog** that Postgres *look up to for user created datatypes and other normal types*.

To add an integer will obviously have a different effect depending on the datatype of the other operands, for example here, we add 1 to an int, an IP address and a date:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128160802.png)
A #catalog is set up like that:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128164017.png)and looks like that:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128164044.png)
## 3.3 Operators
In Postgres extension, it is also possible to create new #operators, here the example is for a **contains** operator. Does the range contain the IP address?![](Pasted%20image%2020231128163324.png)
### Operator classes
An #operator-class organise a set of functions as an API allowing the creation of  indexes (see [4. Index](4.%20Index.md)).
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128163636.png)
Postgres does not have any hard coded knowledge, it is sorted in different #catalogue that it has to look-up to understand the queries.
1. The first part of this example is the *looking for the contain operator*;
2. The second part is to *look-up to find the code of the operator*;
3. Finally, *look-up if there is an index on the column*.
## 3.4 Indexes
To improve Postgres and the time taken for a certain query in a column. An #index can be created to the column to run through its content faster.
There exists several different indexes:
- BTree
- GiST, Generalised Search Tree
- SP-Gist, Space Partitioned Tree
- GIN, Generalised Inverted Index
- And more (BRIN, bloom,...)

It is possible to add #constraints to the indexes:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128164524.png)
### 3.4.1 B-Tree
#B-Tree is very useful because we can directly compare every item.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128164719.png)
### 3.4.2 GiST
It is slower than #B-Tree because a B-Tree is focused while #GiST is **generalised**. It can't be implemented using a B-Tree because some elements are not strictly greater, etc.

### 3.4.3 GIN
#GIN

## 3.5 Postgres Extension example
[6.-Postgres-Extensibility](6.-Postgres-Extensibility.pdf#page=24).
To ease this part, we will use an example of new type: the $base 36$. It is **internally** a bigint, **visually** a base36 number. It reuses Postgres internals and provide new I/O functions
### 3.5.1 Use the extension
To use the extension, we must create an instance of the extension in the database. Then use the type defined and the function that are needed.

$\to$ **Note:**  *generate_series* is a function that generates numbers between two values.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128165415.png)
### 3.5.2 I/O functions
The **I/O functions** allows to transform the **internal value to the visual value** of a type.
The send and receive functions exists to store efficiently the data in memory.

To create those, you need to define them in SQL and the corresponding function in C. So basically here when the SQL will be executed, it will apply the corresponding c function.

Here is the **SQL code** for the **I/O functions**
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128165604.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128165618.png)
Here are the matching C functions:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128170241.png)Once all this done, we **can create the type in SQL**:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128170319.png)
Finally, we need to add the functions for the **casting** of our type:![](Pasted%20image%2020231128170458.png)
### 3.5.3 Reuse Postgres Internals
We can reuse Postgres internals functions to avoid rewriting all the functions.![](Pasted%20image%2020231128170743.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020231128170755.png)
### 3.5.4 Operators
The final step for finishing our extension is to add operators and what they do (which procedure will be applicated).![](Pasted%20image%2020231128170915.png)
And the operator class:
