## 1.1 Query Planning: Translation SQL into Relational Algebra
- #Relations are **tables** whose columns have names, called attributes 
-  The **set of all attributes of a relation** is called the #schema of the relation 
- The **rows** in a relation are called #tuples
- A relation is **set-based** if it does not **contain duplicate tuples**.
- It is called *bag-based otherwise*. 
- A Relational Algebra #RA operator takes as input 1 or more relations and produces as output a new relation

Example of queries:

#SQL is a **declarative language**, meaning that the *user describe what he wants, not how to achieve it*. The #RA is a **procedure** that is used to describe how to get the result.
### 1.1.1 Query planning

We can see it as a #pipeline:
- **SQL**: we describe what we want;
- After the #translation. The **logical query plan** is what can be executed by a computer and is in #RA;
- After the #logical-plan-optimisation we have **optimised logical query plan**, this should be faster than the dumb way to get the data (use algorithms,...);
- We then have the #physical-plan-selection that, depending on the data, computes the operators a certain way to be more efficient. It allows to **go out of the Query Compiler**;
- We then have the **physical query plan** (the machine code) that will go through the execution engine.

Query translation works in steps:
- #Lexical-Analysis, a syntax checking that allows to check for misspelling and that returns a **Stream of tokens**.
- #Syntactic-analysis, we associate a value on a keyword to its meaning that allows to build the **abstract syntax tree**.
- A #transformation to obtain the **logical query plan**, the #RA.

The rest of the #RA is detailed [1.-Database-System-Architecture](1.-Database-System-Architecture.pdf#page=16).
## 1.2 Flattening subqueries in bag-based relations
The **requirements to flatten into a normal join**:
- There is a uniqueness condition that ensures that the subquery does not introduce any duplicates if it is flattened into the outer query block.
- Each table in the subquery's FROM list (after any view, derived table, or subquery flattening) must be a base table. 
- The subquery is not under an OR.
- The subquery is not in the SELECT list of the outer query block. 
- The subquery type is EXISTS, IN, or ANY, or it is an expression subquery on the right side of a comparison operator.
- There are no aggregates in the SELECT list of the subquery. 
- The subquery does not have a GROUP BY clause. 
- The subquery does not have an ORDER BY, result offset, or fetch first clause.
- If there is a WHERE clause in the subquery, there is at least one table in the subquery whose columns are in equality predicates with expressions that do not include any column references from the subquery block. These columns must be a superset of the key columns for any unique index on the table. For all other tables in the subquery, the columns in equality predicates with expressions that do not include columns from the same table are a superset of the unique columns for any unique index on the table.
