MD5 (ELECH417.ova) = 9e31121c6717233b5a000fbb851decd5


[How to produce the MD5]

- On Windows: certutil -hashfile ELECH417.ova MD5

	- Open your terminal ("CMD" in your search bar)
	- Go where you .ova file is (e.g. use the command "cd C:\Users\...")
	- Write this command (without quotes): "certutil -hashfile ELECH417.ova MD5"
	- Wait 2-3 minutes (since the file is heavy ~5 GB)
	- Compare with your result (tips: you juste need to check the 2-3 first and last digits since the result should be really different if the file is wrong).

- On Mac (to verify): md5 -r ELECH417.ova

	- Open your terminal
	- Go where you .ova file is (e.g. use the command with the "cd" command)
	- Write this command (without quotes): "md5 -r ELECH417.ova"
	- Wait 2-3 minutes (since the file is heavy ~5 GB)
	- Compare with your result (tips: you juste need to check the 2-3 first and last digits since the result should be really different if the file is wrong).


[Explanations]

A file checksum is a process which consists of passing a file through a hash function in order to obtain its "fingerprint".

A hash function (such as MD5, SHA, ...) is a uni-directional function ("impossible" to find the input knowing the output) 
which deterministically produces an output which changes completely with the slightest changes in the input. 

It is not uncommon for large file transfer to be corrupted (e.g. bit-flip). Therefore we provide the hash of the file to allow 
those who download it to verify its integrity (verify that the file has not been modified/corrupted during transfer).
