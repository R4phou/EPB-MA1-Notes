Reference book is real good.

In this chapter, we will talk about **what are the internet and protocols**. But also what is the difference between the edge and the core of the network.
**Network edge**: hosts, access network, physical media.
**Network core**: packet/circuit switching, internet structure.
## 1.1 The Internet
It is enormous, there are more or less between 8 and 10 billions computers linked to the internet.
![[Pasted image 20230921105008.png]]
### A Nuts and bolts view:
The internet is composed of different elements.

Billions of connected computing devices where:
- **hosts** = end systems
- running network apps at Internet's edge

**Packet switches**: forward packets (chunks of data).

**Communication links**: fiber, copper, radio, satellite with a certain transmission rate - *bandwidth*.

#network : collection of devices, routers, links that are managed by an organisation.

The #Internet is a *network of networks*. There are multiple Interconnected ISPs.
- There are #protocols **everywhere**, for example for control of sending, receiving of messages (HTTP, TCP, IP, WiFi,...).
	- We *combine the protocols* to get to do what we want. For example if a packet is lost, it's not the problem of the WiFi protocol so we use another one.
- Internet standards are also present
	- #RFC: Request For Comments
	- #IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force.
### A services view
There are **infrastructures** that *provides services to applications.*
- Web, streaming video, multimedia teleconferencing, email, games, e- commerce, social media, inter- connected appliances,…

Internet provides a **programming interface** to distributed applications:
- "Hooks” allowing sending/receiving apps to “connect” to, use Internet transport service
- Provides service options, analogous to postal service.
## 1.2 Protocols
#Protocols define the *format* and  *order* of *messages sent and received* among network entities, and *actions taken* on message transmission, receipt.
![[Pasted image 20230921110352.png]]
## 1.3Network edge
The Network edge is composed by #hosts: #clients and #servers. The servers are very often used as data centers.![](Pasted%20image%2020231224093954.png)
### Hosts
The **host sends packets of data**. 
- It *takes the application message*.
- **Breaks** it **into** smaller chunks known as **packets of L bits**.
- Transmit packet into access network at **transmission rate R**. The link transmission rate can be called *link capacity* or *link bandwidth*.![[Pasted image 20230921111710.png]]
 Packet transmission #delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = $\frac{L}{R} = \frac{bits}{bits/\sec}$
## 1.4 Network core
The network core is a mesh of interconnected routers.![](Pasted%20image%2020231224094409.png)

It takes care of the #packet-switching: **hosts break application-layer messages into packets**. And the *network forwards packets from one router to the next,* across links on path **from source to destination**.
### 1.4.1 Two key network-core functions
#forwarding and #routing 
![[Pasted image 20230921112127.png]]
#### Forwarding
**Forwarding** or switching is a **local action**: *move arriving packets* from router's input link to appropriate router output link.

Left red line in the picture above.
#### Routing
**Routing** is a **global action**: *determine source-destination paths* taken by packets by using routing algorithms.

Right red lines in the picture above.
### 1.4.2 Packet-switching
#packets #packets-switching
The idea of **packet switching** is that a packet is sent from a router to another thanks to a link. The *packet waits in the memory/buffer before it is sent to another router on a link*.
#### Store and forward
![[Pasted image 20230921112947.png]]
**Packet transmission delay**: takes $\frac{L}{R}$ seconds to transmit (push out) L-bits packet into link at R bps.
**Store and forward**: the entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link.
#### Queueing
![[Pasted image 20230921113154.png]]
#queueing **occurs when work arrives faster than it can be serviced.**

The **problem** is that we have **queueing and losses**.  If the arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for some period of time:
- The packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link.
- Or the packets can be dropped (lost) if the memory (buffer) in router fills up!

Therefore there are **alternatives**, such as the *circuit switching*.
### 1.4.3 Circuit switching
#circuit-switching
**Circuit switching** consists in an end-end ressources allocated. A reservation for "call" between the source and the destination is made.

The circuit is reserved to transmit data, once the transmission is done, it "frees" the circuit.![[Pasted image 20230921114023.png]]
- In the diagram, each link has four circuits, the call gets second circuit in the top link and the first in the right link.
- There are *no sharing of circuits*.

It was used for the phone lines before.

There are two possibilities to share a #frequency in the circuits.
![[Pasted image 20230921114544.png]]
### 1.4.4 Packet vs Circuit switching
#packets #circuit #vs
![[Pasted image 20230921114255.png]]

**Packet switching** is better for *variability*, for "bursty" data. Sometimes data needs to be send but at other times not. It is simpler because there is *no need for a setup*.

But **circuit switching** is more efficient when there are queuing or data losses. Because there can be *excessive congestion* in the **packet switching** method.

For packet switching to avoid excessive congestion, protocols are needed for reliable data transfer, *congestion control*.

Note that it is also very difficult to provide a circuit-like behavior with packet switching.
## 1.5 Internet structure
The internet can be seen as a #network *of networks*:
- Hosts connect to internet via **access Internet Service Providers** #ISP.
- Access ISPs in turn must be interconnected so that any two hosts can send packets to each other.

It results to a network of networks that is very complex, its evolution is driven by economics and national policies.
### 1.5.1 Connexion of ISPs
It is impossible to connect every ISP (access net) to every other ISPs, there would be $O(N²)$ connections which is way to much.

Another idea is to **connect each access ISP to one global ISP**. It is a good option but there is a need for an economic agreement between the customers and the providers. There will also be concurrence between global ISPs and we have another problem!

We then add **Internet exchange points** #IXP points between the different global ISPs.

Sometimes there are no IXP but only a **peering link** between two ISPs.

There can also be a **regional network** that arise to *connect access nets to ISPs*.
![[Pasted image 20230921151323.png]]
Some **content provider networks** #CDN such as Google, Microsoft may run their own network to bring services or content close to the end users.
### 1.5.2 Synthesis
![[Pasted image 20230921152020.png]]
At the center there are only a few number of well-connected large networks.
## 1.6 Performance: loss, delay and throughput
We can have #packets-delay due to a **queue** in router buffers, when they are waiting for they turn for transmission. The queue length grows when the arrival rate to link exceeds the output link capacity.

We can have #packets-loss when the memory to hold queue packets is full.
### 1.6.1 Packet delay
There are **four sources** for a packet delay:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230922142446.png)
- **Queuing**: $d_{queue}$ represents the time waiting at output link for transmission and depends on the congestion level of the router.
- **Transmission**: $d_{trans} = L / R$ where $L$ is the packet length (bits) and $R$ the link transmission rate (bps). It is the *time taken to push all bits of a packet into the network links*.
- **Propagation**: $d_{prop} = d / s$ due to the length of the physical link ($d$) and the propagation speed ($s=~2*10^{8} \frac{m}{\sec}$). It is the *time taken in the link*.
- **Nodal processing**: $d_{proc}$ due to the checking of the error bits, the determination of the output links (typically < microsecs).
$$ d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{prop}$$
### 1.6.2 Traffic intensity
The **traffic intensity** is really helpful to determine the delay.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230922142818.png)
#arrival-rate #traffic-intensity 
$L*a / R = 0$ means a **small queuing delay** 
$L*a / R > 1$ means that **more is arriving han can be serviced** $\to$ infinite delay!

In the first third of the graph, ideal situation. Second third, it is linear, there is some waiting but one come in when one come out. On the end of the graph, there is a lot of delay and it keeps increasing.

<font color="#2DC26B">On the Internet</font>, **traceroute** programs provide delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination. For all i: 
- Sends three packets that will reach router i on path towards destination (with time-to-live field value of i) 
- Router i will return packets to sender 
- Sender measures time interval between transmission and reply

### 1.6.3 Packet loss
**Queue** preceding link in buffer has **finite capacity**, packet arriving to full queue is dropped (lost). The *lost packets may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not*.

## 1.7 Protocol layers, services models
Networks are complex and have many pieces: hosts, routers, links, applications, protocols, hardware, software,... But is there a way to organise the structure of the network.

An idea is to use **layers** #layers such as in an  [air travel](Chapter_1.pdf#page=48).  *Each layer implements a service via its own internal-layer actions and relying on services provided by layers below*.

The **interest** of layering is that the modularisation *eases the maintenance and updating* of the system. A change in a layer's service implementation is transparent to the rest of the system!

A **packet on a layer does not care what the other layers do**!

Note that on the image below, it is the path followed by the message. But *on the application layer point of view, only the message is seen, this means that a **direct link** could be inserted between the source and destination application layer*. This applies for all layers.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925164959.png)
The **application layer** exchanges #message to implement some application services of transport layer.

The **transport layer** protocol transfers M from one *process* to another, using services of the network layer.
- It *encapsulates* the application layer message (M) with transport layer header $H_{T}$ to create a **transport layer** #segment.

The **network layer** protocol transfers the transport-layer segment $[H_{t}|M]$ from one *host* to another, using link layer services.
- It *encapsulates* the transport-layer segment with a *network layer-layer header* $H_{n}$ to create a **network-layer** #datagram.

The **link layer** protocol transfers the datagram $[H_{n}|H_{t}| M]$ from *host* to neighboring host, using network-layers services.
- It *encapsulates* the network datagram with a link layer header $H_{l}$ to create a *link-layer* #frame.
