The goal of #chap5 is to understand how the forwarding tables or flow tables are computed. And to understand the principles behind network control plane.
- Traditional routing algorithms
- #SDN controllers
- Network management, configuration
- ...

Let's remember that 
- #forwarding is to **move packets from router's input to appropriate router output** and is *local*. This is handled by the #data-plane 
- #routing is to **determine the route taken by a packet from source to destination** and is thus the *global* view of it. This is handled by the #control-plane.

As seen in #chap4, the #control-plane can be approach by two ways. 
- **Per-router control plane** $\to$ Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control plane.
- #SDN **control plane** $\to$ Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in routers.

## 5.1 Routing protocols
The **goal** of a #routing-protocol is to determine the good paths (equivalently routes) *from the sending hosts to receiving hosts* through a network of routers.
- A #path is the sequence of routers packets that traverse from a given initial source host to a final destination host.
- A **path is** #good if it's the *least cost* or the *fasted* or the *least congested*.

Here below is the **classification of routing algorithm**:![](Pasted%20image%2020231231154744.png)
In this chapter we will talk about a graph $G = (N,E)$
- with $N$ the **set of routers** $=\{u,v,w,x,y,z\}$
- and $E$ the **set of links** $=\{{ (u,v), (u,x), (v,x), (v,w), (x,w), (x,y), (w,y), (w,z), (y,z) }\}$

The **cost** is *defined by a network operator*, it could always be 1 or inversely related to the bandwidth, or inversely related to the congestion, etc.
- $c_{a,b}$ is the *cost of **direct** link connecting $a$ and* $b$
### 5.1.1 Link state
#Dijkstra link-state routing algorithm is:
- #centralised network topology
- The link costs are known to all nodes.
- It **computes the least cost paths** from one node ("source") to all other nodes $\implies$ outputs a #forwarding-table for that source node.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231231160448.png)
#### Examples
Here are examples of uses for #Dijkstra algorithm:![](Pasted%20image%2020240102090916.png)In this example, we can see that the resulting #forwarding-table for the node $u$ shows the route that needs to be taken to go to all other nodes.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102091035.png)Here with some numbers, we can see that once a node is reached, it is blocked and there is no need to compute further.
#### Discussion
**Algorithm complexity**: n nodes
- *Each of n iteration*: need to *check all nodes*, w, not in N
- $(n+1)/2$ comparisons: $O(n^2)$ complexity
- more efficient implementations possible: $O(n \log n)$ 
**Message complexity**:
- each router must broadcast its link state information to other n routers
- efficient (and interesting!) broadcast algorithms: O(n) link crossings to disseminate a broadcast message from one source
- *each router’s message* crosses $O(n)$ links $\implies$**overall message complexity**: $O(n2)$

When link costs depend on traffic volume, #route-oscillations are possible.
	For example, a routing to destination $a$, traffic entering at $d,c,e$ with rates $1, e(<1),1$
	The link costs are directional and volume dependent.![](Pasted%20image%2020240102091638.png)
### 5.1.2 Distance vector
The #distance-vector (DV) algorithm is based on #Bellman-Ford equation:![](Pasted%20image%2020240102090705.png)
#### Bellman-Ford Example
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102091747.png)
#### Distance vector algorithm
The **key idea**:
- From time-to-time, each node sends its own distance vector estimate to neighbors
- When $x$ receives new DV estimate from any neighbor, it updates its own DV using #Bellman-Ford equation$$D_{x}(y)\leftarrow min_{v}\{c_{x,v}+D_{v}(y)\}$$ for each node $y\in N$.
- Under minor natural conditions, the *estimate $D_{x}(y)$ converge to the actual least cost $d_x(y)$*.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102092208.png)

What is important to retain is that:
- It **takes time to converge**, multiple iterations as it diffuses through the circuit.
- It **computes and change only when necessary**.
![Chapter_5_v8.0](Chapter_5_v8.0.pdf#page=24)

#### Link cost changes
When a **link cost changes**:
- The node detects local link cost change
- It *updates routing info* and *recalculates local DV*
- If the DV changes, it *notify neighbors*.

**Good news travels fast**:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102092840.png)

**Bad news travels slow**![](Pasted%20image%2020240102093146.png)We can see that we have the #count-to-infinity-problem. The cost of the links will not stop to increase.
### 5.1.3 Comparison LS and DV algorithms
#link-state #LS algorithm and #distance-vector #DV algorithm both have pro's and con's.

In terms of **message complexity**:
- #LS: $n$ routers $\to O(n^2)$ messages sent
- #DV: exchange between neighbors, the *convergence time varies*.

In terms of **speed of convergence**:
- #LS: $O(n^{2)}$ algorithm, $O(n^2)$ messages but *may have oscillations*.
- #DV: Convergence time varies
	- may have routing loops
	- #count-to-infinity-problem 

In terms of **robustness**, what happens if a router malfunctions, or is compromised?
- #LS:
	- router can advertise incorrect *link* cost 
	- Each router computes only *its own table*
- #DV:
	- DV router can advertise incorrect *path* cost (I have a really low cost path to everywhere) #black-holing
		#black-holing occurs when the malfunctioning router advertises inaccurate distance vector information, causing other routers to forward traffic through the faulty router, which then *drops or misroutes the traffic, resulting in data loss or network disruption*.
	- Each router's table are used by others $\implies$ *error propagate through the network*.
## 5.2 Intra-ISP routing: OSPF
### 5.2.1 Making routing scalable
The current routing study so far is **idealised**. There are *assumptions made* that are not true in practice.
- All routers are identical
- The network is flat

The #scale is **billions of destinations**.
- We *can't store* all destinations in routing tables
- Routing tables *exchange would swamp links*.

In terms of **administrative autonomy**, we already said that internet is a #netwok of networks. And *each network* *admin* may want to control routing in its own network.

### 5.2.2 Autonomous Systems #AS 
The **Internet approach** to #scalable-routing is to **aggregate routers into regions** known as *autonomous systems* #AS (aka. domains).

The study of those will be in two parts:
- #Intra-AS (aka intra-domain): this will concern **routing among within same** #AS 
	- *All routers in AS* must run *the same intra-domain protocol*
	- Routers in different AS can run different intra-domain routing protocols
	- #gateway-router: at the **edge of its own AS**, has links to routers in other AS'es.

- #Inter-AS (aka inter-domains): this will concern **routing among AS'es**
	- The #gateway-router's perform inter-domain routing.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102095816.png)


A #forwarding-table for #gateway-router is configured by #Intra-AS **and** #Inter-AS routing algorithms.
 - #Intra-AS routing *determines entries for destinations within* #AS 
 - #Inter-AS and #Intra-AS determine entries for external destinations.


Now let's suppose that a router in AS1 receives a datagram outside of AS1. The router forward the packet to a #gateway-router in AS1, but which one?

$\to$ The #Inter-AS routing of AS1 must:
1. Learn *which destinations are reachable through AS2* and which *through AS3*.
2. *Propagate* this reachability info *to all routers in AS1*.

The most common #intra-AS #routing-protocol are:
- #RIP **Routing Information Protocol** (classic DV - exchanges every 30s - no longer widely used) #lab1 [GROUPE_D_LAB_1](GROUPE_D_LAB_1.pdf).
- #EIGRP **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol** ( #DV based - faster, more optimal for #BGP (*Border Gateway Protocol*) - used a lot).
- #OSPF **Open Shortest Path First** ( #LS protocol)

### 5.2.3 OSPF - Open Shortest Path First routing
It is **open**, publicly available.

It uses *classic* #link-state #LS 
- each router floods #OSPF link-state advertisements (directly over IP rather than using TCP/UDP) to all other routers in entire #AS
- multiple link costs metrics possible: bandwidth, delay 
- each **router has full topology**, uses #Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute #forwarding-table

#security: all  #OSPF messages are authenticated to prevent malicious intrusion.

#OSPF is **hierarchical** with a *two-level hierarchy*: **local area** and **backbone**
- #LS advertisements flooded only in area or backbone, but not both.
- Each node has *detailed area topology*. It only knows direction to reach other destinations.
