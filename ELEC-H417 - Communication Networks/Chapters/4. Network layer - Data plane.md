The goal of #chap4 is to understand the principles behind the **network layer services**, focusing on data plane:
- network layer service models
- forwarding versus routing
- how a router works 
- addressing 
- generalized forwarding 
- Internet architecture
## 4.1 Network layer - Overview
#network-layer 
### 4.1.1 Services and protocols
The **transport** segment from sending to receiving #host:
- **sender**: encapsulates #segment into datagrams and passes to the link layer. #sender 
- **receiver**: delivers segments to transport layer protocol. #receiver 
The network layer #protocols are in **every Internet device** (hosts and routers).

The #router :
- *Examines the header fields* in all IP datagrams that passes through it.
- It also *moves the datagrams from the input ports to the output ports* to transfer datagrams along an end-end path.

In order to know where the router needs to send the packets, we use **network layer functions**:
- #forwarding: move packets from a router’s input link to appropriate router output link (*step by step what to I need to do, getting through single interchange*).
- #routing: determine route taken by packets from source to destination (*take a map and trace the route*)
### 4.1.2 Data plane - Control plane
A #data-plane:
- is **local**, per router function
- Determines how the datagram *arriving on the router input port is forwarded to the router output port*
$\implies$ Similar to #forwarding

A #control-plane:
- is a **network-wide** logic
- Determines how the datagram **is routed** **among routers** along end-end path from source host to destination host.
- There are two approaches:
	- *traditional routing algorithms*: implemented in routers
	- *software-defined networking* #SDN: implemented in (remote servers)
$\implies$ Similar to  #routing 

A **per-router** control plane: **Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router** interact in the control plane. (uses #Dijkstra).![](Pasted%20image%2020231019103617.png)
A #SDN (Software-Defined Networking) control plane: **remote controller computes and installs forwarding tables in routers**. Here the routing algorithm is centralised. It is **super efficient** but if an **attack** occurs in the remote controller we have nothing left!
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019103709.png)
### 4.1.3 Network-layer service model
The #service-model for "channel" transporting datagrams from sender to receiver:![](Pasted%20image%2020231230133214.png)
Internet is a **best effort** model. Even though there are *no guarantee on*:
- Successful datagram delivery to destination 
- Timing or order of delivery 
- Bandwidth available to end-end flow
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019104219.png)

The #best-effort services is good for:
- **Simplicity of mechanism** has allowed Internet to be widely deployed adopted.
- Sufficient **provisioning of bandwidth** allows performance of real-time applications (e.g., interactive voice, video) to be “good enough” for “most of the time”. The *speed is x10 when the price is x2*!
- **Replicated, application-layer distributed services** (datacenters, content distribution networks) connecting close to clients’ networks, it allows services to be provided from multiple locations
- Congestion control of “elastic” services helps.
$\to$ It is REALLY GOOD!
## 4.2 Routers
A  **high level of generic** #router architecture:![](Pasted%20image%2020231019111013.png)
The switching itself is done by the **routing processor** commanded by a software.
### 4.2.1 Input port function
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019111250.png)
The **line termination** is the #physical-layer: a bit level reception.
The **link layer protocol** receive, we need a specific chip for each type needed (WiFi, Ethernet,...) #chap6 
The **decentralised switching** (red):
- Using header field values, lookup output port *using* #forwarding-table in input port memory (“match plus action”).
- Goal: complete input port processing at ‘line speed’ 
- *Input port queuing:* if datagrams arrive faster than forwarding rate into switch fabric
- We base the forwarding based on the destination IP address - **destination-based forwarding**![](Pasted%20image%2020231019111709.png)
- Or the forwarding is based on any set of header field values - **generalised forwarding**
#forwarding 
#### Longest prefix matching
The #longest-prefix-match is the method when looking for the **forwarding table entry** of a given destination address, we use the *longest address prefix* that *matches the destination address*.![](Pasted%20image%2020231230134119.png)The #longest-prefix-match is often performed using ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs).
- Content addressable: present address to TCAM, retrieve address in one clock cycle regardless of table size.
### 4.2.2 Switching fabrics
#Switching fabrics concerns the *transfer of a packet from the input link to the appropriate output link* inside a router.
The **switching rate** is the *rate at which the packets can be transferred from inputs to outputs*. For N inputs, the switching rate N times line rate desirable.![](Pasted%20image%2020231019113350.png)
There are three types of switching fabrics:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019113414.png)
#### Via memory
The **first generation of routers** are traditional **computers** with **switching** under direct **control of the CPU**. The packet is copied to the system's memory and the speed is limited by the memory bandwidth.![](Pasted%20image%2020231023144442.png)
#### Via a bus
The datagram goes from the input port memory to the output port memory via a shared bus. The **bus contention** is the *switching speed limited by the bus bandwidth*.
#### Via an interconnection network
There are multiple networks possible: crossbar, clos networks,...
We talk about **multistage switch** for $n\times n$ switch from multiple stages of smaller switches.
The interconnection networks exploits #parallelism: it *fragments the datagram into fixed length cells* on entry and *switch the cells through the fabric* and finally *reassemble the datagram* at the exit.
The scaling, using multiple switching “planes” in parallel: ▪ speedup, scale up via parallelism.
### 4.2.3 Input and output port queuing
*If the switch fabric is slower than the input ports combined*, there may be #queuing.
#### Input queuing
**Head-of-the-Line blocking** #HOL, queued datagram at the front of the queue prevents the others in the queue to move forward.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231023150214.png)
#### Output queuing
**Buffering** is required when the datagrams arrive from the fabric faster than the link transmission rate allows. There is then the question of the *Drop policy*, which datagrams to drop if there are no free buffers?

The **scheduling discipline** chooses among the queued datagrams for transition. There sometimes is the notion of priority in the scheduling.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231023151012.png)

#### Buffer management
#skip
### 4.2.5 Packet scheduling
#skip
### 4.2.6 Network Neutrality
How to know what has priority on what etc. Therefore, we introduce the #network-neutrality, on:
- a **technical way**: how an ISP should share/allocate its ressources (using mechanisms as packet scheduling, buffer managements)
- **Social, economic** principles: protecting free speech, encouraging innovation and competition.
	- If place for one packet, take the one from YouTube or the one from daylimotion?
It is enforced by **legal rules and policies**.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019114257.png)
## 4.3 IP - Internet Protocol
#Internet hosts and routers network layer functions:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019114750.png)
### 4.3.1 IP Datagram format
#### IPv4
An #IPv4 #datagram format.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231019114937.png)
The **upper layer protocol** is a number over 8 bits that explains everything that is below it. To know what decoding function you have to give the remaining packet. 

- The address space is of 32 bits, which is not limiting (not many remaining IPv4 addresses left).
- Enforce the use of #NAT which make the network more complex.
- No built-in security.
#### IPv6
![](Pasted%20image%2020231230160552.png)
We can see that there is **no**:
- #checksum 
- fragmentation/reassembly
- options (available as upper-layer, next-header protocol at router).
![](Pasted%20image%2020231230141156.png)
#IPv6 contains:
- **Larger address space** 128 bit addresses (avoid address exhaustion)
- **Built-in security** (IPsec,...)
- Enhanced support for Mobile devices.

![](Pasted%20image%2020231230142515.png)
The IPv6 addresses are segmented into 8 groups of four HEX characters separated by a colon ":". 50% is for network and 50% for the interface IDs (that is a LOT of interfaces).

The addresses can be written in **compact format**: :0000: becomes ::, :0001: becomes :1:, etc.

**The fixed size of IPv6 is better for the routers**.



Not every machine as an IP, it is the **interface** that has an IP, this means that a router can have multiple IPs as it has several interfaces (one for each #subnet).

The problem that already occurred is that **a big proportion of the bandwidth is used for the headers**. It is a big problem for real time communication.
#### Special IP addresses
In #IPv4:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231230143543.png)
Note that #CIDR **Classless InterDomain Routing** allows to define an **arbitrary length** for the #subnet portion of the address.

In #IPv6:![](Pasted%20image%2020240107091918.png)
### 4.3.2 IP addressing - Interfaces
#IP will group the addresses that have the same prefix together.

The #IP-address is a 32-bit identifier associated with each *host* or *router* **interface**.
In #IPv4, the addresses of 32 bits are divided in 4 groups of 8 bits:
- min: 0.0.0.0
- max: 255.255.255.255

The #interface is the **connection between host/router** and a **physical link**. The **routers** have typically *multiple interfaces* while the **hosts** has *one* or *two* (Router = wifi router, host = computer).
![](Pasted%20image%2020231020145148.png)
### 4.3.3 Subnets
A #subnet is a *set of interfaces connected to a router*. (The groups we were talking about just above, in blue in the picture). It is a device interfaces that can physically reach each other without passing through an intervening router.

If it is not inside of the subnet, the matter is sent to the router that will send it somewhere else. The **router serves** as a **master** of the subnet.

A **recipe for defining subnets**:
- Detach each interface from its host or router, creating “islands” of isolated networks.
- Each isolated network is called a #subnet.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231020152424.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020231230144352.png)
### 4.3.4 DHCP and broadcast
The goal of this section is to answer these questions..
1. How does a *host* get IP address within its network (host part of address)?
2. How does a *network* get IP address for itself (network part of address)?

To answer the first question, there are 2 solutions:
- Hard-coded by sysadmin in config file
- #DHCP **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**: dynamically get address from a server.
#### DHCP
The goal is that the: *host dynamically obtains IP address* from network server when it “joins” network.
- can renew its lease on address in use
- allows reuse of addresses (only hold address while connected/on)
- support for mobile users who join/leave network

Typically, DHCP server will be collocated in router, serving all subnets to which the router is attached.

This is the #DHCP overview:
- host #broadcast DHCP discover msg [optional] 
- DHCP server responds with DHCP offer msg [optional] 
- host requests IP address: DHCP request msg 
- DHCP server sends address: DHCP ACK msg

The #client/server scenario. A #DHCP client needs an address in the following network:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231230150855.png)The DHCP server is 223.1.2.5.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231230151153.png)The  steps are:
1. Sends to broadcast to check if a DHCP server exists
2. The broadcast responds that he exists and send an IP address that the arriving client can use.
3. The clients says to the broadcast that he would like to keep the address.
4. The broadcast confirms that the clients can keep the address.

Note that the 2 first steps can be skipped if the client remembers and wishes to reuse a previously allocated address.

*yiaddrr* is the proposed IP address.

*Transaction ID* exists so that we know that the broadcast answers to this question and not another by mistake.

The #DHCP can return more than just allocated IP address on subnet:
- address of first-hop router for client
- name and IP address of DNS sever
- network mask (indicating network versus host portion of address)
#### Broadcast
A quick side explanation for #broadcast. It is a communication method where **data is sent from one sender to multiple recipients within a network**, allowing information to be **distributed to all connected devices simultaneously**. In IPv4, the broadcast address (e.g., 255.255.255.255) is used for sending data to all devices on a local network.

The address of the #broadcast is always the last host. And the first host is the address for the network.

For #IPv6, there is **no broadcasting**. Instead, the #multicast-address $FFfs::/8$ is used.
- #RS (**Router Sollicitation**): #host sends to all routers by using #multicast-address $FF02::2$
- #RA (**Router Advertisement**): #router's send to all-nodes #multicast-address $FF02::1$ This is done periodically or in response to #RS. This message contains routing informations.
This approach is more #scalable.
### 4.3.5 Transition from IPv6 to IPv4 - Tunneling and Encapsulation
#lab2 [GROUPE_D_LAB_2](GROUPE_D_LAB_2.pdf).
In order to use #IPv6 and #IPv4, we need to be able to go from one to the other. Indeed, not all routers can be upgraded simultaneously. The objective is that the network still needs to operate with mixed IPv4 and IPv6.

This can be done by #tunneling and #encapsulation.
#### Tunneling
We talk about #tunneling when #IPv6 datagram **is carried** as payload in an #IPv4 datagram among #IPv4 routers. 

This is *used a LOT* (Proximus that transits from IPv4 to IPv6 etc.).![](Pasted%20image%2020231230161717.png)
This is implemented by the routers. When we have two IPv6 routers that wants to communicate but there is an IPv4 network in the middle.
$\implies$ We add/modify a router that serves as **encapsulation router**.  We talk about #GRE encapsulation (**Generic Routing Encapsulation**).![](Pasted%20image%2020231230162000.png)Here we can see that indeed, from B to E, the IPv6 datagram is the payload of the IPv4 datagrams that goes from B to C, from C to D and from D to E.
### 4.3.6 VPN
#lab4 [GROUPE_D_LAB_4](GROUPE_D_LAB_4.pdf).
A #VPN or **Virtual Private Network** for #IPSec operates primarily at the #L3. Here we will talk about #IPsec #VPN #tunnel. The goal of such a tunnel is to *ensure security and data integrity* while sending a #datagram from one source to its destination.

This is done by **encrypting** the #datagram and is defined by a #IKE **Internet Key Exchange**.
This #IKE contains:
- #encryption method: AES-128,...
- #hash method: SHA-1,...
- #TTL: 86400s,...

A **pre-shared password** is also defined in order for the destination to decrypt the encrypted datagram.

The routers that are encrypting packets should not encrypt all received packets. Therefore, an #ACL (**access control list**) is made to determine which packets are subject to transformation.

Then the #IPSec transform is defined (using #IKE) and linked in the **crypto map** to the receiving peers.
## 4.4 Middleboxes
#Middleboxes consists in **any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal**, standard functions of an IP #router *on the data path between a source host and destination host*.

There are several examples such as #NAT, #firewall, #cache, load balancer or application-specific middleboxes.
### 4.4.1 Network Address Translation NAT
[GROUPE_D_LAB_5](GROUPE_D_LAB_5.pdf). #lab5
#NAT or **Network Address Translation** allows all devices in a local network to share just **one** IPv4 address as far as outside world is concerned.

The router that is at the limit of the subnet and connected to internet can be configured with #NAT. It will then show **one public address**, and redirect the messages to the corresponding host (private address) depending on the port it receives the message from.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231230154223.png)
In the example below, **all datagrams leaving local network have same source NAT IP address**: 138.76.29.7, but different source port numbers.

And #datagram with source or destination in the local network have 10.0.0/24 address for source, destination.

**All devices in local network have 32-bit addresses in a “private” IP address space** (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 prefixes) that can only be used in local network.
#### Advantages
The advantages are that:
- **just one IP address needed from provider ISP** for all devices
- can *change addresses of host in local network without notifying outside world*
- can *change ISP without changing addresses of devices in local network*
- **security**: devices inside local net not directly addressable, visible by outside world
#### Implementation
The #NAT router must transparently 
- **replace** *(source IP address, port #)* of every outgoing datagram to *(NAT IP address, new port #)*
- **remember** (in the NAT translation table), every *(source IP address, port #)* to *(NAT IP address, new port #) *translation pair
- **replace** *(NAT IP address, new port #)* in destination fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding *(source IP address, port #)* stored in NAT table
### 4.4.2 Firewalls
#lab5[GROUPE_D_LAB_5](GROUPE_D_LAB_5.pdf).
The goal of #firewall is to **filter packets flow depending on the source, destination and/or protocol** of the packets that **arrive in the router**. As it is implemented on a #router it is thus logically a #L3 system.

When a packet tries to pass through the #router where the #firewall is set up, the firewall **checks the** #blacklist / #whitelist to see if the packet can pass through or if it should be stopped. 

A #blacklist is an #ACL (Access Control List) that **allows every packets to go through** the #firewall router **except those matching the conditions in the list**.
- Simpler but dangerous as we need to think of all possible threats.

A #whitelist is also an #ACL but this **denies access for everyone** and allows and **let** only **pass** the **packets that matches the list conditions**.
- High security but requires constant updates.
