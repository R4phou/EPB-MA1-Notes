The #chap6 concerns the #link-layer #L2 and its services:
- error detection, correction
- Sharing a broadcast channel and allowing multiple access
- Link layer addressing,
- Local area networks #LAN such as Ethernet of VLANs.
## 6.1 Link layer introduction
### 6.1.1 Terminology
A little terminology:
- #host and #router here are considered as #nodes 
- The communication channels that connect adjacent nodes along communication path are #link's
- #L2 packet is called a #frame: it **encapsulates the datagram**.

### 6.1.2 Responsibility
The #link-layer has  the responsibility of **transferring datagram from one node to physically adjacent node over a link**.

The datagram is transferred by different link protocols over different links and each link protocols provides different services. The following analogy is quite good
	**Trip from Princeton to Lausanne** 
	• limo: Princeton to JFK 
	• plane: JFK to Geneva 
	• train: Geneva to Lausanne 
	$\to$ tourist = #datagram 
	$\to$ transport segment = *communication link* 
	$\to$ transportation mode = *link-layer protocol* 
	$\to$ travel agent = #routing algorithm
### 6.1.3 Services
All the #link-layer #services are described shortly below (they will be explained more in details in the following sections).

**Framing, link access**:
- encapsulate datagram into frame, adding header, trailer
- channel access if shared medium
- “MAC” addresses in frame headers identify source, destination (different from IP address!)
**Reliable delivery between adjacent nodes**
- we already know how to do this! 
- seldom used on low bit-error links 
- wireless links: high error rates
**Flow control**:
- pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes
**Error detection**: 
- errors caused by signal attenuation, noise.
- receiver detects errors, signals retransmission, or drops frame
**Error correction**: 
- receiver identifies and corrects bit error(s) without retransmission
**Half-duplex and full-duplex**: 
- with half duplex, nodes at both ends of link can transmit, but not at same time
### 6.1.4 Implementation of link layer
#Link-layer is **implemented in each-and-every host** in a *network interface card* #NIC or on a chip.

It attaches itself into host's system buses. This is a *combination of HW, SW and firmware*.

$\implies$ When 2 interfaces are communicating:
- #sender side **encapsulates** #datagram in a #frame and **adds error checking bits**, **reliable data transfer**, **flow control**, etc.
- #receiver side **looks for errors, reliable data transfer, flow control**, etc. And **extracts** #datagram to *pass is to upper layer* at the receiving side.

## 6.2 Multiple access protocol
There are different **multiple access links**: point-to-point or broadcast.

In a single shared broadcast channel, two or more simultaneous transmissions by node can lead to *interference* or #collision if the node receives two or more signals at the same time.

A #multiple-access-protocol is a **distributed algorithm** that *determines how nodes share a channel*. The communication about channel sharing must use the channel itself as there are no out-of-band channel for coordination.
$\implies$ The idea is to **avoid communication at the same moment on a node**.

It is not really distributed because some are not centralised (for example 5G or USB where USB hub **interrogate each node to see which one has something to say then give it access**).

An **ideal** #multiple-access-protocol:
- given a #MAC **multiple access channel** of #rate $R$ bps
- Desiderata
	1. When one node wants to transmit, it can send at rate $R$
	2. When $M$ nodes want to transmit, each can send at average rate $R/M$
	3. Fully decentralised:
		1. No special node to coordinate transmissions
		2. No synchronisation of clocks, slots
	4. Simple
### 6.2.1 Different MAC protocols
**Channel partitioning**:
- Divide channel into smaller "pieces" (time slots, frequency, code)
- Allocate pieces to node for exclusive use
	*Each user* that wants to communicate is *placed on a special frequency* then back to the normal
	*Round robin* - each one has a little bit of time and turn, in a circle
**Random access**:
- Channel *not divided*, allow #collision
- Then *recovers* from collisions
	No division but *every terminal* will try to *compete to have access* to the communication medium *for the entire time* (equivalent to student that raises arm to ask a question).
**Taking turns system**:
- Nodes take turns, but nodes with more to send can take longer turns.
	Each terminal can have an opportunity to transmit something or give it to the next
### 6.2.2 Channel partitioning MAC protocols
#TDMA **Time division multiple access**
- *Access to channel in “rounds”* 
- Each station gets *fixed length slot* (length = packet transmission time) in each round
- *Unused* slots go *idle* 
Example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packets to send, slots 2,5,6 idle.![](Pasted%20image%2020240102110841.png)
#FDMA **Frequency division multiple access**
- Channel spectrum *divided into frequency bands* 
- Each station *assigned fixed frequency band* 
- Unused transmission time in frequency bands go idle 
Example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packet to send, frequency bands 2,5,6 idle.![](Pasted%20image%2020240102111006.png)
### 6.2.3 Random access protocols
When **node has packet to send**
- Transmit at full channel data rate R. 
- No a priori coordination among nodes
When *two or more transmitting nodes:* #collision 
**Random access MAC protocol** specifies: 
- How to *detect collisions* 
- How to *recover from collisions* (e.g., via delayed retransmissions)
Examples of random access MAC protocols: 
- ALOHA, slotted ALOHA 
- CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA

The idea is to send and see what happens if there is a problem, try to fix it.
#### CSMA - Carrier sense multiple access
This is an example of *random access MAC protocol*.

A simple #CSMA **listens before transmitting**:
- *if channel sensed idle* $\to$ transmit the entire #frame 
- *if channel sensed busy* $\to$ defer transmission
As humans, we can see this as "don't interrupt someone that is talking, listen and talk when your friend has finished".
##### CSMA - Collisions
#Collision can still occur with carrier sensing. For example, if a *propagation* #delay means that two nodes may not hear each other's just-started transmission. Then, the **entire packet transmission time is wasted**. 

$\to$ The distance and propagation #delay play a role in determining the collision probability.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102112140.png)

##### CSMA/CD
#CSMA/CD is a #CSMA with **collision detection**
- #collision detected within short time
- Colliding transmissions are **aborted**, which *reduces the channel wastage*
- Collision detection is easy in wired but really difficult with wireless.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102112216.png)
#### Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm
The idea is to wait for $n$ round of transmission.![](Pasted%20image%2020240102112459.png)If there are more than 16 collision, the cards are supposed to be jammed and a message is sent to the OS.

If less terminals are communicating, you have more chance to communicate yourself as you have more bandwidth.
## 6.3 LAN's
### 6.3.1 MAC addresses
First, a small recap of the different addresses we have:
- #IP-address 32-bit
	- #L3 address for #interface 
	- Used for #forwarding 
	- e.g.: 128.119.40.136
- #MAC (or #LAN or physical or Ethernet) address
	- Used *locally* to get #frame **from one interface to another physically connected interface** (same subnet, in IP-addressing sense)
	- 48-bit MAC address (for most LANs) burned in #NIC ROM, also sometimes software settable
	- e.g.: 1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD
	Note that #MAC is 48 bits long because the inventor wanted to put the most bits possible as he thought it would become super important. But he had only limited budget so he spent every last cent he had to have the longest possible MAC address (the longest, the most expensive it gets). So it's not for functionality reasons, only budgetary ones ^^.

**Each interface on** #LAN (*Local Area Network*) has a **unique** 48-bit #MAC address and a **locally unique** 32-bit #IP-address.![](Pasted%20image%2020240102113450.png)
MAC address allocation is administered by IEEE.

The manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space to assure uniqueness.

As an analogy, MAC address is like a SSN while IP address is the postal address.

The MAC flat address is #portable, **we can move interface from one LAN to another**.
	Recall that #IP-address are **not portable** as it depends on the IP subnet to which the node is attached.
### 6.3.2 Addressing and Address resolution protocol ARP
The objective of this protocol is to *determine the interface's MAC address* when *knowing its IP address*.

For that, we use the #ARP table, **each IP node** (host or router) on #LAN has a table that contains:
- IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes
- #TTL  (**Time To Live**): time after which address mapping will be forgotten (typically 20 min).$$<\text{IP address};\text{MAC address}; TTL>$$
To **send a** #datagram **from $A$ to $B$ via $R$**
Focus on addressing at IP (datagram) and MAC layer (frame) levels:
	Assume that:
	- $A$ knows $B$'s IP address
	- $A$ knows IP address of first hop router, $R$
	- $A$ knows $R$'s MAC address![](Pasted%20image%2020240102114446.png)
On terminal $A$ - #sender
- #L3 Create IP #datagram with source $A$, destination $B$
- Encapsulate #datagram in #frame #L2 with $R$'s #MAC address as frame's destination
- Transmits #L2 frame from $A$ to $R$.

On #router $R$ - relay
- On #L2 **receive** #frame,  remove the #datagram and **passes it up to IP** #L3 
- **Determines the outgoing interface**, passes datagram with IP source $A$, destination $B$.
- R creates a #L2 #frame containing the A-to-B #datagram and the frame destination is $B$'s #MAC address.
- Transmits #L2 frame from $R$ to $B$

On terminal $B$ - #receiver 
- Receives #frame, extract IP #datagram destination $B$
- Passes the datagram up protocol stack to IP (from #L2 to #L3).
![Chapter_6_v8.0](Chapter_6_v8.0.pdf#page=29)
### 6.3.3 Ethernet
The sending interface **encapsulates** the IP datagram in #Ethernet #frame.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102120025.png)
**Preamble**:
- used to synchronise receiver, sender clock rates
- 7 bytes of 10101010 followed by one byte of 10101011
**Addresses**: 6 byte source, destination MAC addresses (if you followed 48 bit $\to$ 6bytes too)
- if adapter receives frame with matching destination address, or with broadcast address (e.g., ARP packet), it *passes data in frame to network layer protocol*
- otherwise, adapter discards frame
**Type**: indicates higher layer protocol
- mostly IP but sometimes Novell, IPX, AppleTalk
- used to demultiplex up at receiver
**CRC**: cyclic redundancy check at receiver
- if an error is detected, the frame is dropped
### 6.3.4 Switches
#lab3 [GROUPE_D_LAB_3](GROUPE_D_LAB_3.pdf)
A #switch is a #link-layer #L2 device that takes an **active role**:
- it stores and forward #Ethernet #frame 
- It examine incoming #frame's #MAC address and **selectively** *forward* the frame to one-or-more outgoing links. When the frame is to be forwarded on segment, it uses #CSMA/CD to access the segment.
- It is **transparent**, hosts are *unaware* of the presence of switches.
- They **don't need to be configured**. They are #self-learning.

For **multiple simultaneous transmissions**:
- hosts have dedicated, direct connection to the switch
- The #switch **buffer packets**
- #Ethernet protocol used on each incoming link, so there are
	- **no** #collision, full duplex
	- Each link is its own collision domain
- #Switching A-to-A' and B-to-B' can transmit simultaneously without collisions.
	- But A-to-A' and C-to-A' can not happen simultaneously.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102121505.png)

Each #switch has a #switch-table in which each entry is *(MAC address of host, interface to reach host, time stamp)*.
	It is very similar to a routing table.

#Switch **learns** which hosts can be reached through which interfaces. When a frame is received, the switch *learns* the location of the sender (incoming LAN segment)
1. Record incoming link, MAC address of the sending host
2. Index the #switch-table using the #MAC destination address
3. If an entry is found for the destination then
		if destination on segment from which frame arrived then
			**drop frame**
		else
			**forward frame** on interface indicated by entry
	Else **flood** (forward on all interfaces except the arriving interface).
![](Pasted%20image%2020240102122206.png)
Here is an example of #forwarding.
	If the frame destination (A') location is unknown, then **flood**
	The destination A location is known so **selectively send on just one link**.

The #switch can be interconnected with other switches (and they self-learn everything they need)!

Here is an example of small institutional network:![](Pasted%20image%2020240102122453.png)
#### Comparison to router
A #router is a #network-layer #L3 device while a #switch is a #link-layer #L2 device.

Both are **store-and-forward**, they examine their respective headers.

And both have #forwarding-table:
- #router compute tables using routing algorithms, #IP-addresses
- #switch learn forwarding table using **flooding**, learning, #MAC-addresses.
### 6.3.5 VLANs
#lab3 [GROUPE_D_LAB_3](GROUPE_D_LAB_3.pdf)
A #VLAN or **Virtual Local Area Network** is a #L2 isolation method that allows to segment a network to *improve security* and *optimise the traffic flow*.

To create a #VLAN, this is generally done in a #switch. The #interface of the **switch is linked to a certain VLAN**.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240103132348.png)
When the VLAN is implemented, PC1 cannot communicate to PC2 even if they are in the same VLAN. This is because the link between both switches needs to be in #trunk mode.

Once the inter-switches link is in trunk mode. PC1 **can communicate with PC2** as they are in the same VLAN (20), but **can't communicate with PC3** as they are *not in the same VLAN*.

To allow #inter-VLAN communication, a #router needs to be implemented, this router is called a #router-on-a-stick. This router (that is a #L3 equipment) will create an #interface **per** #VLAN (remember that an interface is linked to an IP address) and perform #encapsulation on the arriving message to the destination VLAN.
	For example, PC1 pings PC3.
		-  PC1 to Switch1 (VLAN 20)
		- Switch1 to Router (VLAN 20) *thanks to trunk mode*
		- Router to Switch1 (VLAN 30) *encapsulation has been made!*
		- Switch1 to PC3 (VLAN 30) *tadaaaa :)*


Note that the link between EtherSwitch1 and the router also needs to be in #trunk mode.
