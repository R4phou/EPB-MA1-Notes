## 2.1 Principles of network applications
### 2.1.1 Creating a network app
To create a network app, we need to **write programs that**:
- run on different end systems (computer, phones, iOS...)
- communicate over the network
$\to$ <font color="#7f7f7f">web server software communicates with browser software</font>

And we **don't need to** **write software for the network-core devices** because those *network-core devices do not run user applications* and *applications on end systems allows for rapid app development* and propagation.
### 2.1.2 Client-server paradigm
#client/server 
The #server is *always on host*, has a *permanent IP address* and is *often in data centers* for  #scaling.

The #client:
- contact, communicate with the server
- may be intermittently connected
- may have dynamic IP addresses
- do not communicate directly with each other $\implies$ always go through a server/router
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928093129.png)
### 2.1.3 Peer-peer architecture
#peer #architecture #P2P 
This **peer-peer** architecture is a decentralized network model where *individual nodes*, or peers, *communicate directly with each other without relying on a central server*.
- The server is *not always on*. And no central server is required, each node can act as a #client and a #server.
- Arbitrary end systems directly communicate together
- **Peers request service from other peers**, provide service in return to other peers.
	- **Self-scalability**: new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands. This allows the network to expand itself really easily. #self-scalability 
- Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses (which results in a complex management).
Example: BitTorrent, Skype, etc.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928093531.png)
### 2.1.4 Processes communicating
A #process is a program running within a host, there *can be multiple process within one host*.

Within a same host, two processes communicate using **inter-process communication** (defined by the OS).

Processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging **messages**.

- #client process: process that **initiates** communication
- #server process: process that **waits to be contacted**
$\implies$ applications with #P2P have both client and server processes.
#### Sockets
#socket
Process sends/receive messages to/from its **socket**. It is analogous to a door:
- The *sending process shoves a message out door*
- The sending process relies on *transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process*
- **Two sockets involved**: one on each side
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928102119.png)
#### Addressing processes
To receive a message, process must have an **identifier**. The host device has a unique 32-bit IP address.

An #identifier includes both #IP-address and #port-numbers associated with process on host.
- HTTP server - port 80
- Mail server - port 25

To send HTTP message to gaia.cs.umass.edu web server:
- IP address: 128.119.245.12
- Port number : 80
### 2.1.5 Application-layer protocol
#application-layer-protocol #protocol
An **application-layer protocol** defines: 
- *Types of messages* exchanged
- The *message syntax* : what fields in messages & how fields are delineated
- The *message semantics* : the meaning of information in fields
- The *rules* for when/how processes send & respond to messages

There are **open protocols**: #open-protocols
- Defined in #RFC, everyone has access to protocol definition
- Allows for interoperability
$\to$ <font color="#7f7f7f">HTTP, SMTP</font>

There are **proprietary protocols**: #proprietary-protocols
$\to$ <font color="#7f7f7f">Skype, Zoom</font>
### 2.1.6 Transport service requirements
An app need the different **transport services**: #transport-service
- **Data integrity**: Some apps require 100% reliable data transfer (not all apps but often).
- **Timing**: Some apps require low delay to be effective (Face Time for example).
- **Throughput** (transfer speed): some apps require a minimum amount of throughput to be effective (multimedia). But some *elastic apps* make use of whatever throughput they get. #throughput 
- **Security**: encryption, data integrity,...
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928103640.png)
### 2.1.7 Internet transport protocols services
#TCP service:
- **Reliable transport** between sending and receiving process
- **Flow control**: sender won't overwhelm receiver 
	- If too much data sent at once, queues in routers or in the receiver will be full and there might be data losses.
- **Congestion control**: throttle sender when network overloaded.
	- Allows to control and to monitor the connection all the time
- **Connection-oriented**: setup required between client and server processes.
- **Does not provide**: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security.

#UDP service:
- **Unreliable data transfer** between sending and receiving process, **unordered**
- **Does not provide**: reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup. 
- no-frills extension of **Best Effort** IP![](Pasted%20image%2020230928104757.png)
The #TCP could not work for video games for example. Because when there are losses, it creates a new congestion because the last packet is resent. It is then really bad because it would cause rollbacks.
#### Securing TCP
**Vanilla TCP & UDP sockets**: 
- No encryption 
- Cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet in cleartext (!) 

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**:
- Provides encrypted TCP connections 
- Data integrity 
- End-point authentication
## 2.2 Web and HTTP
### 2.2.1 Web overview
A #web page consists of **objects**, each of which can be stored on different Web server. Those objects can be HTML file, JPEG image, JAVA applet, audio file,...

#Web-page consists of **base HTML-file** which includes several referenced objects, each addressable by a #URL.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928105458.png)
### 2.2.2 HTTP overview
#HTTP or **HyperText Transfer Protocol** is a Web #application-layer-protocol based on a client/server model:
- #Clients: browser that *requests*, *receives*, (using HTTP protocol) and “*displays*” Web objects.
- #Server: Web server *sends* (using HTTP protocol) objects in *response to requests*.

HTTP uses #TCP:
- **Client initiates** TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80
- **Server accepts** TCP connection from client
- **HTTP messages** (application-layer protocol messages) **exchanged between browser** (HTTP client) **and Web server** (HTTP server)
- **TCP** connection **closed**.

HTTP is **stateless** #stateless, which means that the *server maintains no information about the past clients requests*.

---
$\implies$Protocols that **maintain “state”** are **complex**! 
- ¨Past history (state) must be maintained 
- If server/client crashes, their views of “state” may be inconsistent, must be reconciled
---
#### HTTP connections
There are two types of #HTTP connections: persistent and non-persistent.
##### Non persistent HTTP connection
#Non-persistent HTTP is used for downloading multiple objects required multiple connections.
1. TCP connection opened
2. *At most one object* sent over #TCP connection
3. TCP connection closed.

![Example of non-persistent HTTP connection](Chapter_2.pdf#page=22)
The **response travel time** #RTT is the time for a small packet to travel from a client to the server and back.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928113102.png)
The **HTTP response time** (per object) :
- one RTT to initiate TCP connection
- one RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return
- Object/file transmission time.
$$\text{Non-persistent HTTP response time}=2 RTT + \text{file transmission time}$$
##### Persistent HTTP connection
#Persistent #HTTP:
1. #TCP connection opened to a server
2. *Multiple objects* can be sent over *single* *TCP*
3. TCP connection closed.

#passurquecasoitdelamatieredexam 
To fix different issues of #non-persistent HTTP connections such as:
- requires 2 RTT per object
- OS overhead for *each* TCP
- Browsers often open multiple parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects in parallel.

A **persistent HTTP (HTTP 1.1)**: $\implies$ the solution!
- Server leaves connection open after sending response (in case a new query comes right after).
- Subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection.
- Clients sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object.
- As little as *one RTT for all the referenced objects* (**cutting response time in half**)!
#### HTTP request message
There are two types of HTTP messages: #request and #response.

An **HTTP request message** (looks generally like this):
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928143323.png)
#### HTTP response message
The **HTTP response** #status-codes appears in the first line in server-to-client response message, it gives information on how the request went.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928114125.png)
#### Other HTTP request messages
![](Pasted%20image%2020231227120832.png)
#POST #GET #HEAD #PUT
### 2.2.3 Maintaining user/server state: cookies
Recall: HTTP GET/response interaction is #stateless.

So **no notion of multi-step exchanges of HTTP messages is needed to complete a Web "transaction"**:
- There is* no need for client/server to track "state" of multi-step exchange*
- All HTTP requests are independent of each other
- No need for client/server to "recover" from a partially-completed-but-never-completely-completed transaction
#### Cookies
![](Pasted%20image%2020230928114652.png)
Web sites and client browser use #cookies to maintain some state between transactions. There are **4 components** in this scheme:
1. cookie header line of HTTP response message
2. cookie header line in next HTTP request message 
3. cookie file kept on user’s host, managed by user’s browser
4. back-end database at Web site

A **cookie** is the "ID" of the client on the server. This means that the server will remember you for a certain amount of time. Note that **the cookie is set by the server** but *saved on the client end-device*! It can be used for: authorisation, shopping carts, recommendations, user session state.
	 • Susan uses browser on laptop, visits specific e-commerce site for first time 
	 • When initial HTTP requests arrives at site, site creates: 
		 unique ID (aka “cookie”)
		 entry in backend database for ID
	  • subsequent HTTP requests from Susan to this site will contain cookie ID value, allowing site to “identify” Susan 

#Problems can occur for privacy because it is not cleared very often and they can see everything you do on the servers/Internet.
- Cookies *permit sites to learn a lot about you on their site*. 
- Third party persistent cookies (tracking cookies) *allow common identity (cookie value) to be tracked across multiple web sites*

To **keep state**:
 - At *protocol endpoints*, maintain state at the sender/receiver over multiple transaction
 - *In messages*, cookies in HTTP messages carry the state.
 $\implies$ This complex state maintaining is not so complex anymore with those solutions.
#### Web caches
The goal of web #cache is to *satisfy client requests* *without involving origin server*. It works by stocking a copy of the documents that transits by it. It can also sometimes answer some queries from the copies, without having to go back to the origine Web server.
- The user configures the browser to point to a local **Web cache**.
- The browser sends all HTTP requests to the cache
	- **if** **object is in cache**, the cache returns the object to the client.
	- **else**, the *cache requests the object from the origin server*, receives the object *and returns the object to the client*.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230929141732.png)
Web cache acts as both #client (to origin server) and #server (for original requesting client).

**Web caching allows** to:
- *Reduce response time* for client request (because closer to client)
- *Reduce traffic* on institution's access link
##### Caching example
![Caching examples and options](Chapter_2.pdf#page=38)
The problem is that:
- Access link utilisation = .97 $\to$ queuing problem! (normally it should be 0.5) #delay 
- LAN utilisation = .0015
- End-end delay = internet delay + access link delay + LAN delay = 2s +minutes + µsecs
	- Note that the internet delay is more 20 ms than 2s.

A solution could be to buy a **faster access link**. It works (faster access link delay) but it is not a good option because it **costs a lot of money**.

Another option is to **install web cache** #cache. It allows 40% of the request to be served by the cache with a low delay (ms). It reduces the rate to browser over access link and so the access link utilisation. Therefore the average end-end #delay decreases. With the **same** **access link**!
## 2.3 E-mail, SMTP, IMAP
#skip
## 2.4 The Domain Name System (DNS)
The IP address (32 bits) is used for addressing datagrams.

A #DNS **Domain Name System** is constituted of:
- A **distributed database** that is implemented in hierarchy of many name servers.
- An **application-layer protocol**: hosts, DNS servers communicate to resolve names (address/name translation).
$\implies$ to be more precise, it is a core Internet function that *has been implemented as a application-layer protocol*.

#DNS-services
- Host name-to-IP-address translation
- Host aliasing 
	- canonical, alias names 
- Mail server aliasing
- Load distribution
	-  replicated Web servers: many IP addresses correspond to one name

The DNS is **not centralised** even though it would be better. But **it is not because** their would be *a single point of failure*, the *traffic volume*, *distant centralised database* and the *maintenance* would be harder to manipulate. 
But also **because it doesn't scale**! There are approximately 600B DNS queries a day for the Comcast DNS and 2.2T DNS queries a day for the Akamai DNS.
### 2.4.1 Distributed database
![](Pasted%20image%2020230929144227.png)
The client wants IP address for www.amazon.com; 1st approximation:
- Client queries root server to find .com DNS server
- Client queries .com DNS server to get amazon.com DNS server
- Client queries amazon.com DNS server to get IP address for www.amazon.com
#### Root name servers
Officials, contact of last resort by the name servers that can not resolve the name. Need to avoid contact with it. It is **incredibly important for the Internet function** (DNSSEC provides security). They are managed by #ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). #root-DNS
#### Top-Level Domain (TLD)
- Responsible for .com, .org, .net, .edu, .aero, .jobs, .museums, and all top-level country domains, e.g.: .cn, .uk, .fr, .ca, .jp
- Network Solutions: authoritative registry for .com, .net TLD § Educause: .edu TLD #TLD
#### Authorative DNS servers
- Organization’s own DNS server(s), providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization’s named hosts 
- Can be maintained by organization or service provider.
### 2.4.2 DNS name resolution
For the examples: host at engineering.nyu.edu wants IP address for gaia.cs.umass.edu.
 **Iterated query**: contacted server replies with name of the server to the contact. #iterated-query![](Pasted%20image%2020230929144516.png)
 **Recursive query**: puts burden of name resolution on contacted name. #recursive-query![](Pasted%20image%2020230929144728.png)
Once (any) name server learns mapping, it *caches* mapping, and *immediately* returns a cached mapping in response to a query
- Caching improves response time 
- Cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time to live #TTL
- TLD servers typically cached in local name servers

**Cached entries** may be *out-of-date*
- If named host changes IP address, may not be known Internet- wide until all TTLs expire!
- Best-effort name-to-address translation!
### 2.4.3 DNS record
#DNS is a distributed database storing **resource records** #RR that is formatted like this:
$$\text{RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)}$$
#TTL means **time to leave**, it is the *time taken to put in cache the parameters DNS before the automatic update*. If it is of 12 hours, it means that the DNS information will stay for 12 hours in the cache before expiring so that new information can be taken into account.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230929145311.png)
### 2.4.4 DNS protocol messages
#DNS query and reply messages, both have the same format:
- A **message header** with
	- **identification**: 16 bits # for query, reply to query uses same # 
	- **flags**: *query or reply*, *recursion desired*, *recursion available*, *reply authoritative*
![](Pasted%20image%2020230929151449.png)
### 2.4 DNS security
#DNS #security
**DDoS** attacks: #DDoS
- bombard root servers with traffic
	- Not successful to date, traffic filtering, local DNS servers cache IPs of TLD servers, allowing root server bypass.
- Bombard TLD servers

**Spoofing** attacks:
- Intercept DNS queries, returning bogus replies, create a "false" DNS server.
	- A solution to that is the DNS cache poisoning. Before there was DNSSEC but it helped for the DDoS.
The DNS is fragile but if you restart it, there is no problem.
## 2.5 P2P applications
Peer to #peer architecture #P2P compared to #client/server architecture.

For #client/server,**the time to distribute F to N clients using D client/server approach** increases linearly in N:
$$D_{C-S}\geq max\left( \frac{NF}{u_{s}}, \frac{F}{d_{min}} \right)$$
The **server transmission** must sequentially send/upload N file copies.
- Time to send one copy ${F}/ {u_{s}}$
- Time to send N copies $NF / u_{s}$
For the **client**, each client must download a file copy:
- $d_{min}$= min client download rate
- min client download time: $F / d_{min}$

For #P2P, the **time to distribute F to N clients using P2P approach** increases linearly in N but so does the other part of the calculation as *each peer brings service capacity*.
$$D_{P2P} \geq max\left( \frac{F}{u_{s}}, \frac{F}{d_{min}}, \frac{NF}{u_{S}+\Sigma u_{i}} \right)$$
![](Pasted%20image%2020230929153249.png)
In conclusion, most OS use a combination of methods depending on the necessity (as the sort in CPA).
#### BitTorrent
[P2P file distribution BitTorrent](Chapter_2.pdf#page=72). Pas fou, en gros, passer par les pc des autres plutôt que par les serveurs.
## 2.6 Video streaming and content distribution networks
#skip 
[Extra Info](Chapter_2.pdf#page=77).
## 2.7 Socket programming with UDP and TCP
The **goal of socket programming** is to learn how to build #client/server applications that communicate using sockets.

A #socket is a **door** between **application process and end-end-transport protocol**.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004145501.png)
There are two types of sockets for two transport services:
- #UDP: **unreliable datagram**
- #TCP: **reliable, byte stream-oriented**

<font color="#7f7f7f">Application Example:</font> 
 1. client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and sends data to server
 2. server receives the data and converts characters to uppercase 
 3. server sends modified data to client
 4. client receives modified data and displays line on its screen
### 2.7.1 Socket programming with UDP
#UDP: **no "connection"** between client and server
- There is **no handshaking before sending the data**.
- The sender explicitly attaches IP destination address and port number to each packet
- The receiver extracts the sender IP address and port number from the received packet.
$\to$ In UDP, transmitted data may be lost or received out-of-order (unreliable).
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004145953.png)
![Chapter_2](Chapter_2.pdf#page=95)
### 2.7.2 Socket programming with TCP
Different cases, handled by #TCP are detailed below.

The **client must contact the server**:
- Server process must first be running
- Server must have created #socket (door) that welcomes the client's contact.
The **client contacts server by**:
- Creating a #TCP #socket, specifying IP address and port number of server process
- When the client create the sockets, the client TCP establishes connection to the server TCP.
When the **server is contacted by the client**:
- The server creates a new socket for the server process to communicate with that particular client.
	- It allows the server to talk with multiple clients
	- The source port numbers are used to distinguish clients #chap3
**TCP provides reliable, in-order byte-stream transfer (“pipe”) between client and server processes**
