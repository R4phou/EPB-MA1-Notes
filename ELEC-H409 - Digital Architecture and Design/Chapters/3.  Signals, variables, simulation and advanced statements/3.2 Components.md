To use components, we need to **define and And-Or-Invert** #AOI component.

The **AOI** becomes a "black box" *with embedded functionality and interface* that defines the way it should be connected with other components.

The interface defines the **ports** to the outside world.

The **AOI** is instantiated inside another module.  Appropriate connections are made to connect input/output ports of the component with internal signals or inputs/outputs.

We speak about **top-level (MUX2)** & **bottom-level modules (AOI)**, this define system #hierarchy.![](Pasted%20image%2020231025092538.png)

## Signal association schemes
**Positional**: internal signal have to follow the order of the signals defined by the entity definition and the component declaration. (left)

**Named association**: no need to respect order, the connections of local signals to ports are explicitly specified. (right)

NO difference of the approach chosen on the final circuit! However *most of designers adopt named associations* (more clear and using right editor easier to write despite more characters to type).
