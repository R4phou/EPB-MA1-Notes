#VHDL being a #strongly-typed language, the signals and variables needs to specify their type.

The **data types** could be further refined using *subtypes*.

If a subtype is declared, the synthesis tool will infer the appropriate number of bits required to encode the object.
## All data types

On top of the integers and scalars, there are **enumerated** and **physical types**.
## Enumerated data types
#Enumerated data types consists of **a set of named values called elements**, members or enumerators of the type. An identifier of that data type can only take one out of the enumerated elements.

A user defined type in VHDL is always an enumerated type.

An example of use is the [Traffic Light model](ELECH409_Th03.pdf#page=38).
