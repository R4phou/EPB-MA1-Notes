## Circuit testing
The **design flow** is about the circuit modeling and the model transformation using computer programs (uses EDA tools).

After each step in the flow we need to make sure that the input we provide is functional, and that the transformed model we obtain is correct.

**Functional simulation** (what we are going to do the most) - checks Boolean functionality and makes rough estimates on area, timing and power.

**Circuit simulation** - models post placement & route are used for final check, called #sign-off: circuit can be implemented and/or manufactured
#skip slides 25-26
## Functional simulation and test-benches
**Test-benches** #TBs are #VHDL modules that don't have IOs. They instantiate the **Unit Under The Test** #UUTT and some internal signals (one per input of UUTT) and assign values to these signals.

A #good-practice is to create one or more #TBs for each module in the design and name it accordingly for easy identification.

Once the circuit and test-bench are simulated, designer gathers outputs in different forms: **waveform**, memory outputs, written data files etc.

The process **stimuli** will continue indefinitely (never stops.)
## Simulation process
The #RTL is first **elaborated** - syntax errors check, design hierarchy is established starting from the top module, an unique copy of each sub-module instance is created.

The order of the instances creation is important (use ModelSim to do it automatically).

During this elaboration, an **unmapped** gate-level netlist is produced and is stored in a sub-directory to root directory named WORK.

When you simulate something it has to be in this library WORK.

After the simulation, the output is analysed by comparing against somethings that we are sure off - **golden specification**.

Process of VHDL modeling, synthesis and simulation is **repeated many times**! Any change in VHDL means re-synthesis & re-simulation & re-validation of the results. 

Some scripts can be used to go faster (~= MakeFile).
