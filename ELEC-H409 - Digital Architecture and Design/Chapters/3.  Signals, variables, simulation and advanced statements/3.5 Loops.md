## Loops
- #Loops enable  repeated “execution” of the statements found in the loop body that must be declared within a process statement.
- In **HW** loops mean **replication of logic structures, so this is very**, VERY different from SW and a source of misunderstandings

There are different loop statements:
- **loop** – *indefinite repetition* of some statements . 
- **while** – placed *before the loop keyword*: statements are repeated *until a given condition* (typically Boolean expression) becomes false . 
- **for** – placed before the loop keyword: statements of the loop body are *repeated for a fixed number of times* (loop index, counter,...)
In this course, only **for**.

## Loop index
In VHDL, a **loop index** can not be assigned a value during the loop. You can assign the value of the index or make operations with it but you can not modify it!
## Loop repeat things in space
When synthesised to RTL schematic, we obtain a **serial connection of identical circuits** in **space** and not in time.

If the loop index is high, the logical depth of the circuit will be high too, resulting in **huge combinatorial delays**.

For this example:

The **circuit after synthesis** looks like this:

We obtain a single block, a #LUT, an FPGA that looks at the #TT and sends to the buffer that sends it to the output.

If we add a 5th input, it will need more time because we would need to decompose the block in two blocks of 4 inputs. Those two blocks can run in // but it will take additional time to merge their results.

**This means that to optimise power/area, we have to lose performance. And to optimise performance, we need more power/area!**
