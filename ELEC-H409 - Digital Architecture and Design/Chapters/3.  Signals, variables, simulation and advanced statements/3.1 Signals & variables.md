## Signals
Signal values assignments **are queued and resolved during the simulation of the process “execution”**. This is why it is allowed to do multiple assignments to the same signal, but we know what this mean at circuit & simulation levels.

The value will not be changed or assigned to the signal during a process but **it will be after the process execution suspends** (here execution means simulation and not synthesis).

A **signal** holds the last value that was assigned and hence **cannot store intermediate results**.![](Pasted%20image%2020231025120557.png)
Here, the value of A is updated only later and not at line 1. And thus the value of C will use the old version of A (so it will not be D)! This can be rewritten with the notations **+ for the future values** and **- for the past values**:![](Pasted%20image%2020231025120852.png)
**All the future values of the signals will be updated simultaneously** here as we are using #Variables.

## Variables
In order to do a program such as here that will put C to the new value of A. We use **variables**.

#Variables allows **explicit assignments** in VHDL and can **be used to store intermediate results** compared to #signals.

They can **be used only in the sequential domain** of the VHDL language, so *inside processes and subprograms*. They *cannot be declared or used directly in an architecture* and *cannot be seen outside the process that declared the variable*. They are #local to that process!
## Signals VS Variables
**Signals** - they *change their value after the new value has been assigned to a given identifier*; this method enables simultaneous assignments of multiples values at the same time, i.e. multiple concurrent circuits that compute things in parallel 
- Notation: <=

**Variables** - they *change their value “instantaneously”*, like we are used to do in standard programming languages and computers; when the assignment takes place, the value is immediately taken (this is of course during simulation) 
- Notation: :=
### Computations using signals
![](Pasted%20image%2020231025084602.png)
The computation is **simultaneous**, all signals are updated at the same time after some #delta-delay. It is then possible the compute the 'future' values using arguments from the past such as here:![](Pasted%20image%2020231025084703.png)
### Computations using variables
![](Pasted%20image%2020231025084743.png)
We assign the same initial values as in signals, but the computation is **sequential**, the update is immediate. The final result of computation is completely different!![](Pasted%20image%2020231025084843.png)

### Comparison
*Declaration*
- Signals **cannot** be declared inside a process or a subprogram 
- Variables **must** be declared inside a process or a subprogram
*Update process*
- Signals **update the signal driver**, new value of the signal is **updated when the process is suspended** 
- Variables **are updated immediately** when the variable assignment statement is executed
*Communication* 
- Signals **communicate among concurrent statements**
- Ports declared in the entity are signals; as said, signals are like wires
- Variables are **used as temporary values in a function description**; useful to factor out common parts of complex equations to reduce mathematical calculations during simulation
*Right-hand side* 
- Signals **on the right-hand side are not a single value**, rather a sequence of waveform elements with associated time expressions 
- **Variables assignment statement is an expression**, there is no associated time, only one value is stored

#Variables are **cheaper** to implement in VHDL simulation since the evaluation of drivers is not needed (but a difference could be seen in big designs). They also **require less memory** during simulation.
## Initial values: synthesis vs simulation
Let's note that the initial values assigned to the signals and variables in the models on the previous example are used **for simulation only**.

During the **synthesis**, **any initial assignments will be ignored**. If we need an initial value for  synthesis, it must be done with a **memory element with** #preset. So that some value can be initialised after the global system reset.
