The designer impact is the most important. The optimisation and design tools are good but they can't do magic so we need to maje proper implementations.

**Micro-architecture definition** and **quality RTL** coding are *key for a good digital circuit design*.

The **optimality of EDA** are always **relative** as *trade offs* are made between performance, area, power and #EDA (Electronic Design Automaton) tool run time.

The #EDA SW needs to deal with a LOT of transistors so they require a lot of CPU power, loads of memory and significant run-times.

Real-world design flow tools come with detailed **design methodologies**.
Here is an example for FPGAs and Xilinx![](Pasted%20image%2020231228120217.png)
