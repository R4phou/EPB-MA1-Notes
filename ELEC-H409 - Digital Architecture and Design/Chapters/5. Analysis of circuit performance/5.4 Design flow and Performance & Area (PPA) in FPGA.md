![](Pasted%20image%2020231228120537.png)
## 5.4.2 Steps
### I. Elaboration and Synthesis
#Elaboration produces the logical view from the input #RTL 
- Those generated models are **good** for *functional analysis* and *simulation*
- But **doesn't involve** *technology dependent mapping* and *optimisation*
- Analysis of elaborated design informs us *how good our RTL spec is* against micro-architecture we had in mind

#Synthesis provides **technology dependent** and somehow **optimal** view of the design
- The *physical implementation properties* are only **estimated!!!** since the design is not routed yet.
- #Area - LUT/FF count and other resource usage
- #Timing - actual vs supplied timing constraints
- #Power - statistically or simulation based

**If one of the above parameters doesn't meet the spec**, there is **no point of going further in the flow**.
### II. Logic and power optimisation
Post synthesis gate-level netlist is manipulated by the tool to further improve the #PPA during #placemenent-and-routing.

#Logic-optimisation methods include
- #Logic-trimming – suppression of unused, or not properly used logic
- #Logic-remapping – further effort into **logic-to-LUT translation** that could possibly lead to even better overall LUT usage
- #RAM-optimisations – *FPGAs do contain dedicated memory instances*, it **decides when to use** the **LUTs memory** or the **real memory instances**

#Power-optimisation pre **or** post placement **but not both**
- **Pre-placement power optimization** transforms *gate-level netlist* and thus can *affect timing for better or worse*
- **Post-placement** keeps the *timing intact*, but generally results in *less power savings*
### III. Placement
The #placement engine positions the cells (LUTs) from the netlist onto the specific sites in the target FPGA device (x,y locations).

The **placement constraints affect the placement engine**
- in a <font color="#2DC26B">good way</font> – they will *provide hints where to look in the design space*, and *where not to spend efforts* $\implies$ **improves** #PPA and **run-time**
- in a <font color="#ff0000">bad way</font> – bad constraints **increase run-time** with *no visible effect*, so this is waste of time & (electrical) energy (think of servers that run EDA SW).

**Quality constraints are crucial for a good design** and are typically elaborated in iterative way, implement design (step-by-step), analyse PPA, modify constraints and re-run. 

They concern:
- I/O or pin position
- Location constraints for a given block (explicit physical constraints)
- Timing Constraints – fundamental !!!
- Netlist Constraints – ex. LOCK_PINS: used to specify mapping between logical LUT inputs and LUT physical input pins
### Physical optimisation
This step is **optional** in the design flow.

It performs #timing-driven **optimisation** of all the paths that did not reach the timing.

Two methods are used: #retiming and #logic-replication

#retiming means **restructuring of FFs**, i.e. changing the FF position to allow better timing on critical paths (better logic depth balance) .
- #Latency remains *unchanged since the same number of FFs* . 
- It is just the *position of the FF in the critical path that changes* (you could potentially do this yourself in RTL, but with effort)![](Pasted%20image%2020231228122823.png)

#logic-replication is the inverse of #Logic-optimisation, if applied, it will **increase the area to gain performance**.![](Pasted%20image%2020231228122818.png)If block *C is in the critical path* (other blocks are fixed) moving C to any other location will make things worse; if timing not met at this stage, we can’t do anything.
	By replicating the block C we offer more flexibility for placement, contribution of wiring to critical path (logic will not be changed) can be reduced!
### IV. Routing
All #pins (terminals) in the design are connected using physical nets.
	#pins = all IO and intermediate logic, LUTs, memory, DSPs etc.

The **routing quality** depends on the *target technology*, *design complexity* (number of nets and pin) and *constraints* (timing or other).

The #routing is #timing-driven, the optimisation will aime to *resolve all timing violations in the system*.

**Poor routing results** are often due to **poor/incorrect timing constraints**!

Routing *can be fast*, but unrealistic timing constraints could lead to uncontrolled run times, thus we usually limit the number of trials

$\implies$ The **timing constraints** affect a lot #routing
![](Pasted%20image%2020231228124107.png)
### V. Timing closure
#Timing-closure is the **process** of *completing the full place and route flow for a given HDL inputs*, and EDA tools parameters that will produce a solution that *satisfies all constraints in the design*.

Constraints are typically refined as we move along with the flow and only when timing constraints are met at previous level, and with a certain margin, we can proceed with the next steps.

**Good timing after synthesis will not guarantee good timing after routing**.

In #FPGA *circuits clock tree synthesis* (clock distribution to all FFs) & *power delivery* is **fully automated** and uses predefined resources; these two tasks could be quite complex in ASICs .

In #FPGA **routing produces final design**, extracted metrics are those of a circuit.

## 5.4.4 Analysis
### 5.4.4.1 Area reporting
The **Total Logic Area** $A_{TLA}$ is the *sum of the area of all logic resources* in the design calculated after synthesis, placement and route.
- LUT for FPGA
- Gates in ASIC.

Ideally the **total cell area** $A_{TLA}$ **should** **be** **equal** to **total core (chip, IC) area** $A_{IC}$, that is the actual silicon die area. But in *practice it never happens*, so we have **unused area** due to place and route complexity.
- Empty space in ASIC
- Unused LUTs in FPGA

This **unused area** needs to be **minimised**, #EDA tools express how well the silicon is used by #design-utilisation $$DU=\frac{A_{TLA}}{A_{IC}}$$
- $DU$ depends on the design complexity, micro-architecture, designer skills, constraint realism, EDA tool chain
- $DU$ is the **most important parameter related to the cost**.

### 5.4.4.2 Static Timing Analysis report - STA
The #STA report gives us more information, such as #WNS and #TNS.![](Pasted%20image%2020231228125308.png)
Finally, it also gives the number of **failing endpoints** (failing paths), below it is 960 over 7973 that failed, 10% is a lot.![](Pasted%20image%2020231228125421.png)
Improving timing with HDL re-design could be hard, **constraints are too aggressive and should be relaxed**.

First report is **post-synthesis** and the other is **post place and route**. We can see that the design clearly did not met timing specifications.![](Pasted%20image%2020231228125518.png)
### 5.4.4.3 Power reporting
#### Setup
*Power simulation are run to derive electrical and thermal needs of the FPGA* (power supply design and cooling).

Assumptions are made on FPGA package, cooling and PCB; also we need logic activity; for quick power estimates toggle statistics are used, i.e. how much often gates/wires switch; common parameter for all gates – could under or over estimate.![](Pasted%20image%2020231228125744.png)
#### Analysis
Total power & temperature reported;
	Note the dynamic (due to switching) and static (due to leakage) power components.

Detailed breakdown per IC component (Clock, wires, logic etc.).![](Pasted%20image%2020231228125626.png)Note that the above report has been generated after synthesis, with no actual toggle statistics, hence the confidence is said to be low; this *can be used as a rough guide*.
