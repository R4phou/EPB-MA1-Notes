When we talk about **circuit** #delay, there are several types
- #combinatorial delay - gates, memories, #LUT in #FPGA etc.
- #sequential delay - linked to flip-flops #FF 
- #wire delay due to interconnect (nets)

**Delays** are calculated using *resistance* $R$, *inductance* $L$ and *capacitance* $C$ values of all components $\implies$ #parasitics
	 If exact parasitic are not known during synthesis, they can be predicated using more or less complex estimators.

The **exact delays** of the circuit will be **known only after placement and route of the design**.
	Depending on the optimisation and design constraints, the form of the logic circuit and gates could change, but the functionality will of course remain preserved.
## 5.1.1 Combinatorial delays
**Timing arcs** - path from inputs to outputs for which we can define a delay. #timing-arc
There is only one timing arc for an inverter.![](Pasted%20image%2020231227142807.png)Depending on the gate function and input data, we can either have **gate rise** or **gate fall** time. This is the *time difference between the input that reached 50% of it's value and the output reaching the same level* (middle part in the graph).

The gate delay depends on the:
- **Input transition time** #slew - time needed to move from 10 to 90% (or 30 to 70% for #CMOS) of the maximum value.
- **Output load** - input pin capacitance of the connected gate $C_{L}$.

Depending on how the transition time is modeled, we have more or less accurate models:
- **Ideal circuits** - no #parasitics, no input transition times, zero load, so no rising or falling times. (This NEVER happens, it's the perfect theoretical case).
- **Linear models** - combine the #TT (transition time) and #CL (load). It is a better approximation used in the past for old #CMOS technologies$$\delta = \delta_{0}+\delta_{1}TT+\delta_{2}C_{L}$$ where $\delta_{i}$ are constants depending on the technology.
- **Non-Linear Delay Models** #NLDM - approximated with a number of points stored as 2D matrices, the delay is specified as a function of #TT and #CL.

On this picture, on the left the **ideal**, the center is **linear** and the right is the #NLDM.

Once the logic functionality is assembled using transistors devices, electrical simulations are performed to extract different points of the #NDLM model that are stored in a **technology library**. This contains all the data and defines how fast the circuit will be.![](Pasted%20image%2020231227143749.png)This is an example.

During the timing analysis, the SW tool will interpolate between different points/gate transistor model is abstracted a,d the simulation process at gate-level is significantly accelerated.

For FPGA circuits there are stored in **device models**.
## 5.1.2 Timing for Flip-Flops
If *control and data input signals change at the same time*, it will be *the value of the input data just before the control signal change that will be stored*. In #DFF.

This assumption is important to **clarify what will happen in case of simultaneous events** on $Clk$ and $D$ (inputs are seen as random).

In other words, the **input data** must **arrive before the rising edge** of the control signal. #set-up-time.
The data should also be kept stable sometime after the clock edge. #hold-time![](Pasted%20image%2020231227144421.png)**If** the set-up and hold times are **not respected** (setup is not respected if change arrive during it), the *FF will not operate correctly*. The value stored is not deterministic (can't be predicted) and the *functional correctness of the memory element is compromised*. This is what we call a #metastability-problem.

Any FF will have synchronous outputs ($Q/Q_{n}$), the data on these pins will appear after certain delay with respect to the clock edge - #clock-output. There are different timing arcs, the delay is due to the those arcs.![](Pasted%20image%2020231227145247.png)Absolute set-up & hold and clock to output time will depend on CMOS device, just like for the INV; they will be characterized upfront and relevant information stored in technology library.

Typical **digital circuits** (even combinatorial ones) are implemented as a *set of input* (source) *and output* (destination) FFs *with gates or LUTs* in the cloud in between – this is why we speak of digital systems described as **Register Transfer Logic** – #RTL![](Pasted%20image%2020231227145839.png)On a first rising edge – **clock launch edge**
	Data is captured on D1 & Q1 will be modified after some delay.
	It will become available at source FF2 input after some time.
And at **capture rising edge**, the same is applied for FF2.	

Data then travels through logic & wires (LUTs) & should arrive before the next **capture** rising edge of the destination FF.
## 5.1.3 Wire delays
Before they were ignored because too small compared to gate delays but now the gates have improved a lot.

#delay in wires depend on
- **wire material** - known in advance (Al, Cu,...)
- **wire cross-section** - known in advance for ICs (including FPGAs)
- **wire length** - this is design and place & route dependent

Timing after previous stages of the design flow will use wire delays models approximating the length .
- After **synthesis** – length predicted* based on gate count & gate connectivity* . 
- After **placement** – length based on *gates, LUTs x, y positions* . 
- After **routing** – real things *since real physical nets* (wires).

$\implies R$ is inversely and $C$ is directly **proportional to** $W$.
$\implies RC$ delay is proportional to $L^2$
![ELECH409_Th05](ELECH409_Th05.pdf#page=13)
To **enable current delivery flexibility FPGAs** implement **fixed length connections with predictable loads** – this comes at a price, *reason why FPGAs will be always less optimal than ASICs*.
### Impact of the wire length on delays
If we scale logic gates, we need to scale wires too, cross section should get smaller but the **delay per unit length will go up** because the wire will contribute more to the critical path. 
	Nothing (or almost) can be done here $\implies$ fundamental problem of #CMOS scaling.

The delay in the wire has **quadratic dependence on** $L$.

To reduce the impact of $L$, we break down long wire by adding buffers or an even number of inverters, this is the #buffer-insertion.![](Pasted%20image%2020231227151532.png)Adding inverters will add delays but remove more as the wire delays will be linear $\frac{L}{n}$ instead of quadratic.
## 5.1.4 Timing at complete circuit level
For sequential circuits with FFs, so including combinatorial logic, we can define different **path group delays** that needs to be checked once the circuit is completed:
- **Input port to register** – from the IC pin to the first FF . 
- **Register-to-register** – from clock input of the launching FF and it’s output, to the capturing FF input and next clock edge . 
- **Register-to-output** – from clock and FF output to output pin![](Pasted%20image%2020231227152324.png)
In FPGAs inputs can be registered at IOB level, (not automated); that way you make sure that input/output delays are minimal.

Because of many IOs and especially many register-to-register paths we need automation to analyze timing at circuit level
