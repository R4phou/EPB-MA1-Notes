Here is the example on which we are going to work here.
## FSM: process view
In #VHDL, FSMs are typically modeled using *two distinct processes*
- **First process** #P1 controls the computation of the next state as a function of inputs and the present state
$\implies$ This is a **pure combinatorial process** #combinatorial-circuit 

- **Second process** #P2 updates the state variables that are stored in FFs to *avoid race conditions*. We want to infer FFs as synchronous storage elements to store the system state.
$\implies$ This process **must be sequential** #sequential

Both process communicate using **shared #signals : CurrentState**.  

Both processes #P1 and #P2 (FSM1 and FSM2) are typically implemented in a single VHDL module:![](Pasted%20image%2020231211161456.png)We can *note that there is a feedback loop on state variables*. This is allowed since there is one FF for every state variable.
$\to$ CurrentState, NextState is a bus
## Complete model - entity and states
States are typically defined using *enumerated types*, #Vivado will automatically encode a unique binary code per state when #state-encoding occurs.![](Pasted%20image%2020231211162302.png)
Then #P1 /FSM1 #sequential #process: **sensitive** to inputs and the **current** system state:![](Pasted%20image%2020231211162407.png)We check (the process runs all the time) the state in which we are then depending on the buttons, we change the nextState and the output.

Then #P2 /FSM2 #combinatorial #process: **sensitive** to clock and reset, enable FSM to **move** in time by updating the current state with the next state.![](Pasted%20image%2020231211162943.png)
