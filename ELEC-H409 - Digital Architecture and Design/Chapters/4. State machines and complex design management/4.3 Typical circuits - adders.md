Any computational problem could be solved in different ways, in #SW we speak of **algorithm**.
- Effective computational procedure, defines in detail how computation are performed
- Assumes certain computer architecture model
- In general algorithm development assumes #Von-Neumann architecture: *data and instructions stored in the same memory* and *machine executes one instruction at a time*.

In #HW we speak of #micro-architecture:
- How a given algorithm is translated into #HW using logic gates and FFs
- How it is decomposed in time
- While design automation allows automated circuit synthesis, **micro-architecture design can not be automatised**.

Even simple operations could be implemented in different ways= fixed point integer addition with #ripple-carry or #carry-look-ahead.
## Ripple carry adder
#ripple-carry #adder is based on **two elementary circuits**: #half-adder and #full-adder.![](Pasted%20image%2020231212090426.png)To implement circuit with generic operands of $n$ bits, we could use:
- 1 #half-adder and $n-1$ #full-adder **connected in series**.![](Pasted%20image%2020231212090517.png)
- This works just fine from the computational and logic point of vue (perfect for simulation)
- **BUT** there is a **big problem** with this approach if it targets physical circuit implementation
	- Critical path will be **VERY** deep, thus the **propagation delay** will be **HUGE**, and thus the circuit **SLOW**.
## Full combinatorial
Another approach is to go fully #combinatorial. **Input words** are concatenated and considered to be *one unique input to the system*

Example: 
	For 2 operands of 2 bits each, we have 3 bits of output, each being implemented using independent combinatorial circuit. $\implies 3 \cdot 2^{4}=48 bits$ way to much!
	The computation needed to carry bit is embedded into the combinatorial problem

We can then extract the logic operations:![](Pasted%20image%2020231212091800.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020231212091808.png)
And use the equations to implement the #VHDL model.
### Analysis
The consequence of this approach is that **the complexity of the circuit is a function of the word size**. *More bits in the word* means *more complex function* which means *more area and a deeper critical path* and thus **worse performance** due to #combinatorial-explosion.

To circumvent the above, real-word adder circuits use some kind of cary prediction and **split the computation into 3 phases**:![](Pasted%20image%2020231212092248.png)

Each type of adder needs to make some trade offs about a certain criterion.
