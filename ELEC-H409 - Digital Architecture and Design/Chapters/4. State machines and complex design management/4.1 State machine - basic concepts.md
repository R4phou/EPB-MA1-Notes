A #state-machine is a mathematical model of sequential circuits, it is known as #FSM **Finite State Machines**, the system can be found in exactly one of a finite number of states at a given time.

It is *represented* using **state diagrams**, an easy way of representing sequential behavior as **transition of states** are shown graphically. Or using **state tables**, that indicate future state in tabular form as a function of inputs and current state.

## State table
The #state-table are more convenient to use as they force us to think of **all possible evolutions** of the system, given the present state. Even more care is taken when writing VHDL, as much as possible evolutions must be analyzed to validate the RTL model.
	The number of states $N$, the number of state variables: $n = \log_{2}N$
Therefore, **more states** $\to$ **more state variables**, hence it is less optimal for the system. Therefore the **optimisation** consists in **reducing the number of states**.

### Tuto
We read current state in the column to the left in the state table 
– this is the present for the machine 

Next (future) states are given in the table depending on the current state & inputs change

Assuming a present state and an input change, the future state is first decided (transition) and then reached (stable state here in bold); state tables “predicts” the future of the machine 

There could be an arbitrary number of transitions between two stable states

Here the value of the output is set according to the current state 
	– Moore state machine 
	– the output is calculated using some combinatorial logic that simply

## State machine classes
Depending on how the system output is calculated, we distinguish between two types of sequential logic machines #Moore and #Mealy.

- #Moore – the **output is function of system state only** 
	- Output needs only a simple decoding (combinatorial) circuitry 
	- We can merge only states with the same output 
	- Possibly *less states could be merged, hence a priori more logic* 
	- **Safer** because they used registered values of state
	- **Easier** to design
- #Mealy – the **output is function of system state & input** 
	- Output logic might be more complicated than in Moore
	- But we can now merge states with different outputs
	- Possibly *more states could be merged requiring less logic*
	- **Fewer states**
	- **Responds faster** - whenever the input changes for the same state, the output will follow (no need for state update)
	- **Transparent to glitches on input**
## State encoding
Optimised #state-table undergoes the **process of** #state-encoding to enable implementation with Boolean logic. Here is an example:![](Pasted%20image%2020231211111913.png)There are multiples encoding possibilities.

In **theory**, #FSM speed is *independent* of the number of states and number of transitions because they are assumed to be instantaneous, so an arbitrary state encoding is ok.

In **real circuits**, this is not the case, more states and transition mean more logic, so slower logic circuits. Therefore state optimisation is important! The #state-encoding could also impact the performance and **influences HW complexity**, hence impact final performance, area and power of the synthesised circuit.
### Different state encoding schemes
#Sequential - same order as given in the state table (binary conversion)

#Random - random

#optimised - find encoding such that one of the following parameter is optimised: *area*, *logic depth*, *fanout*, *bit flips*,...

#gray - one bit changes at a time, safer for glitches, good for asynchronous implementation (avoid race conditions), not always possible for example when transition from and to all states.

#One-hot - **one bit of the state vector per state**
 - All other state bits are 0: $n$ states results in $n$ state (FF example 1,2,3,4 into 0001, 0010, 0100, 100
 - Any transition involves 2 bit flip
 - #One-hot encoding generate loads of bits for the state vector and we have *a lot of unused combination of the state variables*. But *logic functions may be very simple*!
### One-hot encoding pros-cons
#One-hot #state-encoding  is good because:
- **Faster** than other encoding techniques
- State **decoding is simplified**, need only to check the state bits to find the state (done by the priority encoder/decoder)
- Additional logic **not required** $\to$ extremely advantageous for big #FSM
- **Low switching activity**, hence lower dynamic power and less prone to glitches
- **Easy** to **add/delete states** $\to$ does not affect the other states
- Easy to find the critical path of the design
- **Particularly advantageous for FPGA implementations** as FPGA have many FFs (one per LUT).

And bad because:
- **Consume area and power**, not really a problem for FPGAs, FFs are there and FPGAs are not low-power device!
