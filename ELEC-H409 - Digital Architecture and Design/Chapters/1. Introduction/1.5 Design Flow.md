## Overview of the digital system design
- Designing digital system is a complex and tedious task, so *divide & conquer strategy is a must*. 
- **Digital circuit design process is decomposed in a** **sequence** **of** different implementation **steps**, called #design-flow.
- The goal of the #design-flow is to *transform the initial system model*, typically described at higher abstraction levels such as behavioral models, *into a detailed low-level physical circuit* (gates and transistors) *that allows actual system implementation* (assembled PCB, programmed FPGA, manufactured ASIC etc.).
- This is done in a progressive manner, with many, MANY, MANY iterations due to circuit complexity & complexity of transforms involved in the design flow.
- Different steps are usually executed by different engineering teams, using many different tools, easy interfacing between design teams (& tools) is (very) important.
## Design Flow steps
- **System specification** – initial description that can be less formal (verbal specs) or more formal (sometimes using high-level description languages); designers typically decide on global system micro-architecture.
- **RTL modeling & functional simulation** – establishment of the HDL model (VHDL, Verilog and/or SystemC) that is tested & validated for functionality only (Boolean correctness) . RTL stands for Register Transfer Logic a paradigm in which logic data flow travels between gates and flip-flops from inputs to outputs; designates a digital system model.
- **Synthesis** – transforms HDL descriptions into Gate-Level Netlist logic representation of the circuit.
- **Placement & Routing** – decide on: where components will be instantiated, so (x, y) location and how they are interconnected, i.e. wires.
- **Sign-off** – various properties of the circuits are validated for manufacturing (timing, power, thermal, mechanical etc.)

## ASIC vs FPGA
Almost the same design flow, we always need to place and route elements.

The difference is that for the **ASICs** we place *standard cells* and in **FPGAs** we place *logic cells, memory blocks or pre-existing DSP*.

For FPGA we need to decide on the LC content, so the optimisation process is different.

Routing in FPGAs is about choosing the pre-existing routes and connecting PSMs, where in ASIC we create dedicated routes.

The final output are bitstream for FPGAs and databases of drawings for ASICs.
