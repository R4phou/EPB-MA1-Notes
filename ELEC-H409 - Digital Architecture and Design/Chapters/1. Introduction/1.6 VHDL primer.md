## Data types
#data-types
Data types are extremely important in VHDL, type conversion is possible but dangerous. Need to be extra careful!

## Assignments, operators & expressions

## Basic building block
In VHDL, basic building block is called #entity. An **entity** will define a HW #module in your design. 
$\to$ A #good-practice is to write one HW entity per VHDL file.
Here is a #template for a HW entity:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004111004.png)
### Entity & circuit view basic building block
Module interface defines #ports: they define the name, direction and type. These **ports** are used to *establish connection (IO) with the external world* (represented by other blocks or outside the chip).

Once the ports become physical, they are logical entities called #pins.

#### Example of a combinatorial circuit
#combinatorial-circuit #example
We use the assignment operator (<=) to connect inputs to outputs using some logic in between.
$\to$ Implement the logic function:
$$z(a,b,c)=a.b.c+a'+b'.c$$

### Port assignment
#ports 
A fundamental rule dictates the port assignment: **No output on the right hand side of the assignment!**
- Otherwise it would mean #feedback on signals (output connected to input)
- And feedback means #sequential-circuit that are #asynchronous that brings #race-conditions!
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004112126.png)
Here we can **NEVER** write an expression as the one in yellow. Because #VHDL is **NOT a programming language**. We do not program FPGA's, we configure them with some logic.
## Sequential circuits - overview
Statement #process is used to describe sequential synchronous & asynchronous circuits. On this part of the course, we only look at **synchronous circuits**.
The **activation of a process** is done through a #sensitivity-list. If one of the signals in this list changes value, this will trigger functional description evaluation.

### VHDL process and clocks
#clocks #process #VHDL 
If the **signal in the sensitivity list is some periodic signal**, such as a clock #CLK, then if the *"branch" is taken, whatever occurs after will only occur during the transition from 0 to 1* of CLK. During the **rising edge**.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004113054.png)
Making circuits that react on the rising edge is a fundamental property of sequential logic circuits. Flip-flop memories are a typical example. **Current dense IC could have millions of logic gates, and hundreds of thousands of Flip-Flops**.
### D Flip-flop
#DFF #Flip-flop #FF
**DFF** has *two inputs*: D, CLK and *one output* Q. The output Q will have the value of D only when the signal CLK changes the value from 0 to 1. Outside the rising edge of the CLK, DFF keeps the old value of D, no matter what is the value of D; this is the mechanism of memorisation. If D and CLK change simultaneously, it is the previous value that will be stored in the DFF.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004113954.png)
Here is the sequential system template modified to have the process that will describe the DFF to be sensitive to CLK:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004114400.png)
This model interprets the **behavior** of the system. This is why VHDL modeling is sometimes referred to as **behavioral modeling**. Designer describes the system behavior in relatively abstracted way, & the SW tools will understand the relative HW component.
### Insisting on memorisation mechanism
The behavior of the #DFF is understood by the synthesis engine that will infer a memory element.
For this #model:
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004114744.png)
We first detect rising edge (1.) and then we "copy" the input D into the output Q (2.).
**Since there is no assignment for  "outside the rising edge", the system should keep the previous value.
Or if Q and D are wires: we must insert a memory to keep that value for the future**.
### Synchronous sequential logic circuit
#sequential-circuit #synchronous  
To avoid race conditions, we add a FF, a synchronous element on the signal path. The FF will be active on the rising edge of a periodic signal (clk), when this occurs, the value on the input will be stored in the FF. 

This value is then kept until the next rising edge. Any change on the input is ignored between two rising edges. 

This is how we make a difference between previous and current value of the same logical net in sequential digital systems that are now synchronous.

## Multiple processes
#process
Logic circuits are **concurrent** by nature, so more than one process can be defined inside a single VHDL module. Process are **independent** one from the other.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231004115200.png)

A #good-practice is to **minimise the number of processes per module**.
