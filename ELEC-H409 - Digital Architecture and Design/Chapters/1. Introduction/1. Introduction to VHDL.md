## 1.1 Introduction
**Digital** 
We will use logic circuits that implements Boolean logic to process binary values (0,1) with a set of predefined logic gates.

**Architecture**
More or less complex systems that process digital information
- Can be  anything (9-bit micro controller)
- *System on Chip (SoCs)* are single **Integrated circuits** #ICs built using millions of logic gates on a single die in an *Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)* #ASIC
- SoCs and ASICs are implemented using #CMOS technology to produce transistors, basic building block of all digital systems.
**Design**
Is about all activities required to effectively build such system (and there are few!)
### Focus
![[Pasted image 20230920104308.png]]
Here we focus on gates (AND, OR, NAND, INV, ...), the second circle.
But we will also look on level 3 for small blocks of a system.
