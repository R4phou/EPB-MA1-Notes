What we saw is that we used **two-level logic** with OR and AND. But in the real world, we use *Multi-level logic*.
## Combinatorial logic circuits
#combinatorial-circuit 
- **Outputs** O are **function of inputs only**
- **Same input combination will always produce the same output**
- Representation done using #TT (truth tables) and logic functions
- #minterms - combination of input variables for which $F = 1$ 
- #maxterms - combination of input variables for which $F = 0$

- This expression is optimised by using different algorithms (Boolean axioms/theorems, K-maps, Quine-McCluskey, Espresso, etc.).
- The optimised representations are often given in the form of #SoP (Sum of Product) by looking into $1s$ or #PoS (Product of Sum) by looking into $0s$.
- The #SoP can then be converted to a logic circuit![](Pasted%20image%2020231212160622.png)$\to$ **All logic functions could be implemented with a set of AND and a single OR gate (SoP)**
## Sequential logic circuits
#sequential-circuit 
- **Outputs** $O$ depends on **inputs** $I$ and **system state** $S$.
- **Future state** - $S^{+}$ is calculated as a *logic function of inputs and previous state* - $S^{-}$ represented using **internal variables**.
- The system output is generally connected to the input by using a Flop. This is a **feedback** loop.
- Sequential logic circuit can be seen as a combinatorial system with one (or more) feedback(s) on state variables.

Remember the state tables, state diagram, boolean logic equations. And the differences between Moore and Mealy machines.

We need to be able to avoid race conditions and glitches.
## Logic circuit design or synthesis
Starts with some initial specification of the system – it has to be correct otherwise your system will not do what you want it to do (which is embarrassing).

Synthesis can be quite complex knowing how much logic gates we can pack in a mm3 these days.

**Formal specification** – we translate the above spec into some kind of a formal model of digital circuit.
**Logic optimisation** – logic description transformation to reach certain objectives (Performance, Power, Area, Cost – PPAC) .
**Logic functions implementation** – circuit assembly.
### Optimisation

### Manual digital synthesis
How to do when we have a lot of logic variables and of states (hundreds of them)? It takes a lot of gates. So we need new alternatives to describe, optimise and implement digital logic circuits.

These alternatives are the HDLs and EDA.
## How to implement logic circuits
![[Pasted image 20230920113707.png]]
There is not one solution to implement a logic circuit. It depends on the needs of the user. But in this course, we will only study FPGA circuits.
### Programmable Logic Array (PLA)
First programmable logic devices to appear where circuit **functionality is not fixed during manufacturing**, but can be decided later!
    - Programming process is permanent though 
    
PLA **implement Sum-of-Products** expressions in hardware.

Regular structure of AND & OR gates (planes) with programmable connectivity.

Limited to appx. 100 IOs and relatively simple logic functions.

As CMOS integration evolved, more IC density allowed more complex PLA circuits → FPGAs.
