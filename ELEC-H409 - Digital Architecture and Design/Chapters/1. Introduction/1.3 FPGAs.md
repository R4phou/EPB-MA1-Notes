An FPGA or Field Programmable Gate Array is a regular structure of:
- **Logic Cells** #LC - implement logic functions using memories to store Truth Tables (logic function output) as function of input (addresses).
	- Sometimes it is called CLB or CLE.
- **Programmable interconnect** – can connect any two (or more) arbitrary points inside the circuit 
- **I/O blocks** – off-chip connection 
- **Memories (SRAMs)** – any digital design needs a memory, often half of the resources could be used for storage (and even more)
- Dedicated logic CPUs, DSPs etc.

## Typical Logic Cell (LC) architecture
#LUT
- Each LC has at least one *Look Up Table (LUT)*, a memory that stores TT of the logic function
	- LUT is an SRAM, 1-bit data with few address bits (<10)
	- LUT output is either connected to combinatorial LC output or through FF or sequential output.

The SRAM is small so it can have fast READ times.

Some #LC have supplementary logic resources to perform certain functionality, typically **carry generation logic** (CY).
## Input/Output (IO) blocks
The #IO blocks enables the communication between FPGA and the outside world through the connection of the FPGA package, the **pad**.

It also allows to adapt different electrical standards used to connect external components (there is a huge variety of IO standards).

It enables synchronization of inputs with internal logic using internal Flip-Flops.

The direction of input/output is programmable.

## Programmable interconnect
The programmable interconnects enables the connectivity between different LCs. Any LC can be connected with any other LC in the FPGA!

Each #LC has a **Programmable Switch Matrix (PSM)**, which is a crossbar. A circuit that connects n inputs to n outputs.

These connections are programmable! It is a huge advantage but the problem is that it introduces a supplementary delay compared to a simple propagation delay from a wire.

## FPGA manufacturing technologies and usage
Some FPGA are :
- Programmable once - **anti-fuse**.
- Reprogrammable - LUTs are implemented using SRAMs, they enable reconfigurable computing.

We use FPGAs for:
- **Low volume production** - ASICs are very expensive and justifiable only for huge volumes (millions of components).
- **Prototyping** - implementation and test before ASIC manufacturing.
- **Reconfigurable systems** - run-time configurability.
## ASIC vs FPGA
There are no gates in an FPGA, there are LUT (memories).![](Pasted%20image%2020231212161026.png)
