## Definition
The #if statement **selects one or more statement sequences** for execution based on the **evaluation of a condition**.

Each condition is a Boolean expression evaluated to TRUE or FALSE. **More** **than one** #elsif clauses may be present, but a **single** #else clause may exist.
## Complete if statement
It works as in python with a few modifications.
Note that **conditional statements leads to multiple paths** depending on the conditions that may be TRUE or FALSE and **that are** **mutually exclusive**.

In a #complete-if statement: assignments for signals are *defined for all possible outcomes of the Boolean condition*.
$\to$ This could be seen as a MUX in HW.

If it is not complete, it would create a #latch: the circuit synthesis will infer storage element to keep the previous signal value. [Example](ELECH409_Th02.pdf#page=51).

Sometimes, the resut may not be as we think, here we have two latches, one for z and one for y. Because in either cases, one of the 2 will not be correctly "defined".![](Pasted%20image%2020231018112056.png)
These **latches** means *more area* needed and *more power* so a *less performant* design!
