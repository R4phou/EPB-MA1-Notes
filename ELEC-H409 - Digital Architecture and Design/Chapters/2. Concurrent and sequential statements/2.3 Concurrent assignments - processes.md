## Concurrent statements
#concurrent 
There are different types of concurrent statements:
- **Concurrent assignments:** previous sections, a <= b;
- **Assert:** used to display messages during simulation

	- The statements will not be synthesised as such, only used to monitor the simulation process.
- **Component instantiation:** how to manage complex designs by creating *design hierarchy*
- **Process:** see next section.
## Process
A #process is a **sequence of VHDL statements** executed in the order specified by the VHDL source. The statements are said to be *executed sequentially*, which has nothing to do with sequential circuits.

Statements are not executed per se, the notion of #execution refers to the execution of the computer programs that performs the circuit simulation.

The designer wants to create a match between the simulation and the synthesis.
### Process: usage
#process are **concurrently** executed within the same HW module.  Logical grouping of processes in one module is the designer choice.

All processes within one module have access to all inputs of the module and all temporary signals. This is something like global/local variables in SW.

During simulation, different processes, even if they are declared in the same module, will appear as a separate event driven piece of SW entity.
### Process declaration structure
It can appear anywhere in the architecture body (but after the *begin* keyword).

The name is optional. It is used for synthesis of the logic circuit and are useful during the circuit simulation.
### Process and sensitivity list
A #process can contain a *optional* #sensitivity-list which is a list of signals to which the process is said to be **sensitive**.

In the second one, the process is only triggered by c. If we change c, it will not be "retriggered". While on the left, if c is changed, the process will be executed again.
