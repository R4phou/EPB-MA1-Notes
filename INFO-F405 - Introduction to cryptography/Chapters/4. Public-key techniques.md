# Reminder - Symmetric vs Asymmetric
**Encryption** #encryption
- *plaintext* $\implies$ ciphertext
- under key $k_{\epsilon} \in K$

**Decryption** #decryption
- ciphertext $\implies$ *plaintext*
- Under key $k_{d} \in K$ 

In #symmetric cryptography: $k_{E}=k_{D}$ is the **secret key**.
In #asymmetric cryptography: $k_{E}$ is <font color="#2DC26B">public</font> and $k_{D}$ is <font color="#ff0000">private</font>.

#Symmetric cryptography: $k_{A}=k_{V}$  is the  <font color="#ff0000">secret key</font>. The tag is called a *message authentication code* #MAC.

#Asymmetric cryptography: $k_{A}$ is private and $k_{V}$ is <font color="#76923c">public</font>. The tag is called a #signature. 

#Symmetric is less versatile but faster. Indeed we can do much more with asymmetric.
# 4.1 Going public
When going public, several problems arrive. The world is not a goof place and people will try everything to go around the solutions imagined. An example of problem is the #man-in-the-middel-attack. Imagine That *Alice gets Mallory's public key*, thinking it's Bob's and *Bob gets Mallory's public key* thinking it's Alice's. Then **Mallory can decrypt and re-encrypt the traffic at will**!![](Pasted%20image%2020231127212629.png)
The **binding of a public key to an identify** can be done through #certificates and **public key infrastructure** #PKI or via web of trust (GPG, GnuPG). #TP4-2-ex3a
##### Public key certificate
A #public-key **certificate**:
- *Allows to bind a public key with the identity of its owner*: this is good because it can prevent attacks such as #man-in-the-middel-attack .
- *Contains at least the public key*, the information *allowing to identify its owner* and a *digital signature on the key* and the information.
- Is signed by a **certification authority**.
[Example Slide 7-8](4-Public.pdf#page=7). #TP4-2-ex3d
##### Certificate hierarchy
![](Pasted%20image%2020240122215023.png)
##### Web of trust
**Manual key verification over an authentic channel** 
- compare the fingerprint (hash function) 
- if correct, sign it 
Public keys are distributed with their signatures. 

**A key is trusted** 
- if the key is signed by me, or 
- if the key is signed by someone I trust.
##### Different public-key algorithms
There are multiple #public-key algorithms depending on the problem on which they are based:
- Factorisation
- #discrete-logarithm-problem : **modular exponentiation** or **elliptic curves** (see 4.4).
- Many more...
## In practice: Hybrid encryption
In **practice**, to improve both **efficiency and bandwidth**, we can combine #asymmetric with #symmetric #encryption.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231127214730.png)Alice sends a **secret key** to Bob encrypted with **his public key**, and she **encrypts the plaintext with her secret key**.
# 4.2 Mathematical background
## 4.2.1 Primes
There are **infinitely many** #primes 
- Suppose that $p_{1} = 2 < p_{2} = 3 < ... < p_{r}$ are all the existing primes.
- Let $P = p_{1}p_{2}...p_{r} + 1 \implies$ $P$ **cannot be a prime** and then let $p \neq 1$ be one of the existing primes that divides $P$.
- But $p$ cannot be any of $p_{1}, p_{2}, ..., p_{r}$, because otherwise $p$ would divide the difference $P − p_{1}p_{2}...p_{r} = 1$, and $p$ would be equal 1.
$\to$ So this prime $p$ is still another prime, and $p_{1}, p_{2}, ..., p_{r}$ would not be all of the existing prime.
## 4.2.2 Groups
A #group is a **set** $G$ along with a **binary operation** $◦$ that *satisfy the following **properties***:
- #closure: $\forall g,h \in G, g ◦ h \in G$
- #associativity: $\forall g_{1},g_{2},g_{3} \in G, (g_{1} ◦ g_{2})◦g_{3} = g_{1} ◦ (g_{2}◦g_{3})$
- #identity (neutre): there exists an identity $e\in G$ such that $\forall g\in G, e◦g=g◦e=g$
- #inverse: $\forall g\in G$, there exists $h \in G$ such that $g◦h=h◦g=e$
$\to$ In easier terms, it is a set in which we can combine elements in a precise way.

Some **examples** of group:
- $(\mathbb{Z}_{n},+)\to$ the set $\mathbb{Z}_{n} = \{0,1,2,\dots,n-1\}$
		The law is *addition mod n*
		The neutral/identity is $0$
		The inverse of $x$ is $-x \text{ mod }n = n-x$
- $(\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{*},\times)\to$ the set $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{*} = \{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}$
		The law is *multiplication mod p*
		Its neutral is $1$
		The inverse of $x$ is $x^{-1}\text{ mod }p$
- $(\{0,1\}, \oplus)$ is a group $=(\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{*}, +)$
- $(\mathbb{N},+)$ is **not a group**
### Order of a group
Let $G$ be a group, the #order of $G$, denoted $|G|$ is **the number of elements in $G$**.
$\to$ $|\mathbb{Z}_{n}^*| = n$ and $|\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{*}| = p-1$
### Exponentiation
Let $(G, ◦)$ be a group, we define the #exponentiation of an element $g$ as$$[x]g = g◦\dots ◦g$$with $x$ times $g$.
*Example*: In $(\mathbb{Z}_{5}^{*},+)\to3[g]=g+g+g$ 
	With $g \in \{1,2,3,4\}$
### Order of an element in a finite group
The **order of an element** $a$ **of a group** $G$ is the smallest positive integer $m = ord(a)$ such that $[m]a = e$, where $e$ denotes the **identity** element of the group.
*Example:* Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_{10}$ and $a=2$. The condition is $m◦a=0\text{ mod }10$. Thus $m=5 =ord(2)$
#TP4-1-ex7

#Theorem: **For any $a$ its order $ord(a)$ divides the size $|G|$ of the group**.
$\to$ This tells us that the candidates for $i$ must be dividers of $|G|$. The $ord(a)=i$ such that $a^{i}\text{ mod } p = 1 \text{ mod }p$ such that $i$ divides $|G|$.

#Fact2: $ord(a^{k})=\frac{ord(a)}{gcd(ord(a),k)}$
$\to$ $ord(2) = 18 \implies ord(4)=ord(2^{2})=\frac{18}{2}=9$

An element $g$ is said to be #generator of $G$ if $ord(g)=|G|$. Thus (by using the theorem), it can be used to generate all the elements of the group.
*Example:* In $G =(\mathbb{Z}_{5}^{*},+)$, the generator can be $2$ as we can generate all elements of the group with it:
	 - $1[2] = 2$
	 - $2[2]=4$
	 - $3[2]=2+2+2=6\text{ mod 5} = 1$
	 - $4[2]=2+2+2+2=8\text{ mod } 5=3$
	 $\to$ All numbers of $\mathbb{Z}_{5}^*$ are generated by $2$. So $2$ is a #generator.
## 4.2.3 Operations
### 4.2.3.1 Modulo
A #modulo is :
- A **binary operation**: $a \text{ mod } n = r$ iff $a = qn + r$ and $0\leq r<n$
- An **equivalence relation**: $a≡b (\text{mod }n)$
	- iff there exists an integer $k$ such that $(a-b)=kn$
	- iff $(a \text{ mod }n) = (b \text{ mod }n)$
##### Modular additions and subtractions
$\mathbb{Z}_{n}, +$ is the set $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$ together with addition modulo $n$.
$\mathbb{Z}_{n},+$ is a #group with
- #identity is $0$
- #inverse of $x$ is $-x \text{ mod } n$

1 is a #generator of the group because all the elements can be represented by adding 1 to itself an appropriate number of times.
### 4.2.3.2 Greatest common divisor
#gcd or **greatest common divisor** is noted $gcd(a;b)$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128104435.png)
#corollary: $a$ and $b$ are relatively #primes (or equivalently $gcd(a, b) = 1$) *iff there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = 1$*
##### Modular multiplications and multiplicative inversion
$\mathbb{Z}_{n}^{*}, \times$ is the set $\{x:0<x<n \text{ and } gcd(x,n) = 1\}$ together with multiplication #modulo $n$.

$\mathbb{Z}_{n}^{*}, \times$ is a #group with
- #identity is $1$
- #inverse of $x$ is denoted $x^{-1}\text{ mod } n$ and is such that $x^{-1}x=1 (\text{mod }n)$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128110014.png)
It is possible to show that the **inverse is unique** under certain conditions (if the number is coprime with the n).
## 4.2.4 Euler's $\Phi(n)$ function
We note $\Phi(n)$ the **number of integers smaller than $n$ and that are relatively prime/coprime with $n$**. So $|\mathbb{Z}_{n}^{*}|=\Phi(n)$.
If $n = \Pi_{i=1}^{r}p_{i}^{e_{i}}$ for distinct #primes$p_{1}, p_{2},\dots,p_{r}$, then$$\Phi(n)= n* \Pi_{i=1}^{r}\left( 1-\frac{1}{p_{i}} \right) $$
Some particular cases 
	- Prime $p$: $\Phi(p) = p-1$
	- Product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$ $: \Phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)$ #TP4-1-ex5

#Fermats-little-theorem: let $p$ be a prime and $a$ an integer not a multiple of $p$, then $a^{p-1} = 1 (\text{mod }p)$

#Eulers-theorem: Let $a$ and $n$ two relatively prime integers, then $a^{\Phi(n)} \text{ mod }n = 1 \text{ mod }n$

As a consequence: the **exponent can be reduced** #modulo $\Phi(n)$:$$a^{e}\text{ mod }n=a^{e\text{ mod } \Phi(n)} (\text{mod }n) = a^{x \text{ mod }n-1}\text{ mod }n$$
## 4.2.5 Generator in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}^{*}$
The group $\mathbb{Z}_{n}^{*}$ has size $\Phi(n)$, hence a #generator $g$ is an element with $ord(g) = \Phi(n)$. Such a generator exists when $n$ is $2, 4, p^{a} \text{ or } 2p^{a}$, with $p$ an odd prime.

The **number of generators in** $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{*}=|\mathbb{Z}_{\phi(p)}^*|$ as $p$ is a prime and thus the group is **cyclic**.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231128113151.png)
## 4.2.6 Chinese remainder theorem #CRT
The #CRT or **Chinese remainder theorem**:
	Let $\{m_{1},\dots,m_{k}\}$ be a set of relatively prime integers, i.e., $\forall 1 \leq i \neq j \leq k, gcd(m_{i}, m_{j})=1$ and let $m$ be their product $m=m_{1}\times\dots \times m_{k}$.
	Then the following system of equations:$$\begin{cases} x \equiv a_1 \pmod{m_1} \\ \vdots \\ x \equiv a_k \pmod{m_k} \end{cases}$$ has one and only one solution #modulo $m$.

To **solve a** #CRT **problem**:
	*Compute* $M_i = \frac{m}{m_i}$, and notice that
		- $\gcd(M_i, m_i) = 1$. 
		- $M_i \equiv 0 \pmod{m_j}$ for any $j \neq i$. 
	*Compute* $c_i = M_i^{-1} \pmod{m_i}$. 
	Let $x = \sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i c_i M_i$. 

Indeed, $x \equiv a_i c_i M_i \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$.
# 4.3 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman #RSA
## 4.3.1 RSA key generation
In #RSA #key-generation, the user **generates a public-private** key pair as follows:
- **Privately** generate two large distinct primes $p$ and $q$
- Choose a **public** exponent $3 \leq e \leq (p-1)(q-1)-3$
	- It must satisfy $gcd(e,(p-1)(q-1))=1$
	- often, one chooses $e\in\{2,17,2^{16}+1\}$ then generates the primes
- Compute the **private** exponent $d = e^{-1} \text{ mod } (p-1)(q-1)$
- Compute the **public modulus** $n = pq$ and discard $p$ and $q$

The #public-key is: $(n,e)$.
The #private-key is $(n,d)$.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240122162215.png)
## 4.3.2 RSA textbook encryption - DONT USE
#RSA From **plaintext** $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ to **ciphertext** $c\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and back:
- #encryption $Enc(m,(n,e)) \to c = m^{e} \text{ mod } n$, return $c$
- #decryption $Dec(c,(n,d)) \to m' = c^{d} \text{ mod } n$, return $m'$
##### Verification
Thanks to #Eulers-theorem, the fact that p and q are distinct #primes and by definition of $e$ and $d$:![](Pasted%20image%2020231213165749.png)
##### RSA textbook signature
#RSA  From **plaintext** $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ to **signatures** $s\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and back:
- #signature Sends $(m,s)$, with $s=m^{d}\text{ mod }n$
- #verification Check whether $m = s^{e}\text{ mod } n$
$\to$ Not secure because if another pair $(m',s')=(m\cdot c^e,s\cdot c)$ is also accepted as is uses the fact that $ed=1\to$ $(s')^{e}=(s\times c)^{e}=s^{e}\times c^{e}=m^{ed}\times c^{e}=m\times c^{e}=m'$
#TP4-2-ex6
## 4.3.3 RSA Attacks
### 4.3.3.1 RSA and factorisation
#factorisation is an #attack on #RSA, and RSA textbook is not really resistant to it:
**If one can factor $n$** into $p × q$, the *private exponent* $d$ **follows immediately**. 

Conversely, **from the knowledge of** $d$, it is easy to factor $n$. 

$\implies$ This is one reason why we should NOT use textbook #RSA.![](Pasted%20image%2020231213170723.png)There is **no known polynomial time algorithm to factor an integer** (polynomial in the size of the integer). 

But **there exist sub exponential algorithms**. The currently best known algorithm (general number field sieve) factors an integer n asymptotically in time:![](Pasted%20image%2020231213170835.png)
### 4.3.3.2 Other attacks on RSA
There are other #attack such as **cyclic attack**, **message factorisation** or **short message attack**.

#short-message-attack consists in the following:
	If $e$ is small (e.g., $e=3$), and if $m < n^{1/e}$ then $m^{e}\text{ mod } n = m^e$ *without any modular reduction*. Therefore $m$ **is retrieved** by simply computing $c^{1/e}$ over the integers.

**Example**: with e=3 and n on 3072 bits, the attack works until m is a 1024-bit integer.
## 4.3.4 RSA for confidentiality
### 4.3.4.1 RSA-OAEP
#RSA #OAEP or **Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding** allows to **counter** #factorisation and the #short-message-attack and to make RSA #IND-CPA-secure.

#OAEP works by **encrypting a message of small size**, **use randomness** in the encryption and then apply the output of #OAEP as #RSA input. 

It allows to make the scheme **probabilistic**, **prevents** that **an adversary recovers any portion of the plaintext without being able to invert RSA** (the adversary can either have everything or nothing).

It is shown to be #IND-CPA-secure assuming that $G$ and $H$ behave as #random-oracle.

#encryption :  $Enc(m,r, (N,e)) = (X ||Y)^{e}\text{ mod } n$ with $(X||Y) = OAEP(m,r)$
	- Add a padding full of 0 to the message to have a fix length $m||padding$
	- Message $m$ of size $n$ max
	- #nonce $r$ of size $k$
#decryption : $(X||Y) = c^{d}\text{ mod } n$, then $\dots m$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231213172719.png)
Note that it is similar to #feistel-network.![](Pasted%20image%2020240122164746.png)It is applied like this to RSA.
### 4.3.4.2 RSA-KEM
#RSA-KEM
In hybrid encryption, **Alice does not have to choose the secret key**, but **she can let it be derived from some random bits** by encapsulating the symmetric key using RSA. It enables **shared key creation**.

To #encapsulate, Alice does the following
1. Alice chooses a random $m$ of the same bit size as $n$
2. Alice encrypts $c = m^{e}\text{ mod } n$, and she sends $c$ to Bob
3. Alice computes $k = hash(m)$

To #decapsulate, Bob does the following
1. Bob recovers $m = c^{d}\text{ mod }n$
2. Bob computes $k = hash(m)$
## 4.3.5 RSA for authenticity
The different options always uses #RSA but there are some modifications made on the message m that is encrypted/signed by RSA.
### RSA: How NOT to sign
For #authentication, let's recall the #RSA textbook signature.
- **Signature**: Send $(m,s)$, with $s=m^{d}\text{ mod }n$
- **Verification**: Check whether $m = s^{e}\text{ mod } n$

But as said earlier, the textbook signature is **not efficient** as a #forgery attack that exploit the multiplicative structure allows to  crack this:![](Pasted%20image%2020231224122939.png)
### RSA with message recovery
**If** the **message** $m$ is **short enough**, we can **embed it in the signature**. 
Let $R(m)\to m'$ be a redundancy function from message space $M$ to range $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathbb{Z}_{n}$.
- **Signature**: Compute $m'=R(m)$ then send $s = (m')^{d}\text{ mod } n$
- **Verification**:
	- Recover $m' = s^{e}\text{ mod }n$
	- If $m'\in\mathcal{R}$, return $m = R^{-1}(m')$ and accept it.
	- Otherwise, reject it.

But this is not used much in practice.
### RSA with full-domain hashing
Let $H$ be an extendable output function (or take an old-style hash function and use MGF1).
- **Signature**:
	- Compute $h=H(m)$ so that $h$ has the same bit size as $n$
	- Send $(m,s)$, with $s = h^{d}\text{ mod } n$
- **Verification**:
	- Compute $h=H(m)$ like above
	- Check whether $h = s^{e}\text{ mod } n$

It is also not used a lot but it is real nice and easy to achieve.
### RSA with probabilistic signature scheme 
#RSA-PSS is a  #signature scheme used with #RSA, it utilises a probabilistic padding scheme to provide a better resistance against certain types of attacks.

It allows the use of variable *salt* length, and it is very much used (standardised for PKCS #1 v2.1).![](Pasted%20image%2020231224124852.png)
## 4.3.6 RSA implementation
This section explains how to compute the RSA (manually or with a computer).
### How to find large primes
#RSA needs **large primes** to be efficient. Indeed, the security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

The number of primes up to $n$ is given by $\pi(n)∼\frac{n}{\ln n}$ for large $n$.

$\to$The average prime gap for numbers of $b$ bits is about $b \ln 2$.

The **recipe**:
- Draw a random number $n$
- Test co-primality with the first few primes $2,3,5, \dots$
- Test **pseudo**-primality  with (e.g. Miller-Rabin)
- Otherwise, increment $n$ and repeat
	This method has been done and used in the exercise sessions.
### Exponentiation using square and multiply
To compute $a^{e}\text{ mod }n$, write the exponent in binary and apply the **square and multiply** *algorithm.* Reduce the numbers modulo $n$ as you compute.
Here is an example for $e = 26 = 11010_{2}$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231224130245.png)
The 1's $\to$ square and multiply
The 0's $\to$ just square.
### Optimisation using the CRT
To speed up the decryption or signature generation, keep $p$ and $q$ and use the #CRT Chinese Remainder Theorem. It allows computing to a smaller power, and thus faster.

Instead of computing $m = c^{d}\text{ mod } n$, compute:
- $m_{p} = c^{d}\text{ mod } p = c^{d\text{ mod } (p-1)} \text{ mod } p$
- $m_{q} = c^{d}\text{ mod } q = c^{d\text{ mod } (q-1)} \text{ mod } q$

Then recombine:$$m = (m_{p}-m_{q})(p^{-1}\text{ mod } q) p + m_{p}$$
# 4.4 Discrete logarithm problem in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{*}$
#discrete-logarithm-problem #DLP 
The #DLP is a problem that has currently **no known polynomial time algorithm to solve it**. It is therefore used for encryption and signatures as we will see here bellow.

First, let's **fix two domain parameters**:
- Let $p$ be a *large* #prime
- Let $g$ be a #generator of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$ (for example: $\{g^{i} \text{ mod } p: i\in \mathbb{N}\} = \mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$)
![](Pasted%20image%2020231224142456.png)
For 128-bit security, NIST recommends p to be at least 3072-bit long.
## 4.4.1 Key generation
#key-generation #DLP
The **domain parameters** 
- Let $p$ be a *large* #prime
- Let $g$ be a #generator of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$ (for example: $\{g^{i} \text{ mod } p: i\in \mathbb{N}\} = \mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$)

The user generates a #public #private #key-pair as follows:
- The **private key** $a$ is made by privately choose a random integer $a \in [1, p-2]$
- Compute the **public key** $A = g^{a}\text{ mod } p$
##### In group notation
The **domain parameters** 
- Let $G$ be #group 
- Let $g\in G$ be a #generator of $G$ of order $q=|G|$

The user generates a #public #private #key-pair as follows:
- The **private key** $a$ is made by privately choose a random integer $a \in [1, q-1]$
- Compute the **public key** $A = [a]g$

The **public key** is $A$ and the **private key** is $a$.
## 4.4.2 El Gamal encryption
![](Pasted%20image%2020240122213524.png)
The objective of #ElGamal is to use the #DLP to secure its methods.

#encryption of $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$ with Alice's public key $A$.
- Choose randomly an integer $k \in [1, p-2]$
- Compute:
	- $K = g^{k}\text{ mod } p$
	- $c = m A^{k}\text{ mod } p$

#decryption of $(K,c)$ by Alice with her private key $a\to m=K^{-a}c\text{ mod } p$

$A$, $B$ and $K$ are all *public*, the **rest** is *private*.

This scheme is #correct because we can recover $m$ by applying encryption and decryption when we fix the parameters.![](Pasted%20image%2020231224144713.png)
##### In group notation
![](Pasted%20image%2020240123140533.png)
### Security of El Gamal encryption
$(K,k)$ can be seen as an #ephemeral #key-pair, created by the sender. 
- $K$ is part of the ciphertext;
- $k$ is protected by the #DLP.
In order to have a **secure ElGamal** encryption, $k$ must be **secret** and **randomly drawn independently at each encryption**! Indeed, if 
- $k$ is known, one can compute $A^k$ and recover $m$ from $c$
- $k$ is repeated to encrypt, say $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ then we have$$c_{1}=m_{1}A^{k}\text{ mod }p\text{ and }c_{2}=m_{2}A^{k}\text{ mod }p$$And thus$$c_{1}c_{2}^{-1}=m_{1}m_{2}^{-1}\text{ (mod p)}$$
***
##### The Diffie-Hellman problem
The Diffie-Hellman Problem #DHP is easier than the #DLP (breaking #DHP does not give us the exponents). However, there are currently **no known polynomial time algorithm** to solve the #DHP either.

First, let's **fix two domain parameters**:
- Let $p$ be a *large* #prime
- Let $g$ be a #generator of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$ (for example: $\{g^{i} \text{ mod } p: i\in \mathbb{N}\} = \mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$)
![](Pasted%20image%2020231224145623.png)
---
To **recover** $k$ or $a$ from $K$ or $A \implies$ #DLP 

But to break ElGamal, it is sufficient to recover $K^{a}=A^k=g^{ak}\text{ mod }p$. Hence, #ElGamal #encryption relies on the #DHP.
## 4.4.3 Diffie-Hellman key agreement
#Diffie-Hellman
This is **hybrid encryption**, we *do not need to choose the secret key*.
First, let's **fix two domain parameters** $p$ and $g$ and:
- Alice's key pair $A = g^{a}\text{ mod }p$
-  Bob's key pair $B = g^{b}\text{ mod }p$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231224151108.png)
This is #correct because: $A^{b}=g^{ab}=B^{a}\text{  (mod p)}$.

Note that the hashing is to have the same size and to avoid it to be uniformly distributed.
##### In group notation
#Diffie-Hellman in #group notation.
First, let's **fix two domain parameters**: a #group $G$ and a #generator $g \in G$
- Alice's key pair $A = [a]g$
-  Bob's key pair $B = [b]g$![](Pasted%20image%2020231224151404.png)
This is #correct because $[b]A =[ab]g = [a]B$

The **problem** with this is that **when they communicate once**, both **Alice and Bob have the same secret key**. Therefore, a more secure encryption scheme would counter that.
##### Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key agreement
#ephemeral #Diffie-Hellman key agreement has for goal to **avoid using the same long-term keys** for all communications.

First, let's **fix two domain parameters** $p$ and $g$ and:
- Alice's key pair $A = g^{a}\text{ mod }p$
-  Bob's key pair $B = g^{b}\text{ mod }p$![](Pasted%20image%2020231224151737.png)
Note that the signature exists to make sure that the keys $E$ and $F$ that are sent (public) comes from Alice and Bob. Otherwise anyone could send a public key and this would ruin the key agreement.
## 4.4.4 El Gamal signature
The #ElGamal #signature of message $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^*$ by Alice with her private key $a$:
- Compute $h = hash(m)$
- Choose randomly an integer $k\in[1,p-2]$
- Compute $r = g^{k}\text{ mod }p$
- Compute $s=k^{-1}(h-ar) \text{ mod }(p-1)$
	- If $s=0$, restart with a new $k$
- Send $(r,s)$ along with $m$.

The #verification of signature $(r,s)$ on $m$ with Alice's public key $A$.
- Compute $h=hash(m)$
- Check whether $A^{r}r^{s}=g^{h}\text{ (mod p)}$

This is #correct because:![](Pasted%20image%2020231224152722.png)
This is done thanks to #Eulers-theorem.
##### Security of ElGamal signature
$r$ and $k$ can be seen as an #ephemeral #key-pair, created by the signer. 
- $r$ is part of the signature
- $k$ is protected by the #DLP 

But we must be careful because $k$ **must be secret and randomly drawn independently at each encryption** (Even more than with ElGamal Encryption):
- If $k$ is known, one can recover $a$ from $s$.
- If $k$ is repeated to sign messages with hashes $h_{1}\neq h_{2}$ then$$s_{1}-s_{2} = k^{-1}(h_{1}-ar)-k^{-1}(h_{2}-ar)=k^{-1}(h_{1}-h_{2}) \text{ mod (p-1)}$$and we can recover $k$, then $a$ from $s_{1}$ or $s_{2}$!

A famous case is SONY that used the same $k$ to sign all their games, so one user recovered $k$ and $K$ and sold a lot of games with it.

To test it in #EC $\to$ #TP4-2-ex14
## 4.4.5 Schnorr signature
#Schnorr #signature of a message $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}^*$ by Alice with her private key $a$:
- Choose randomly an integer $k\in[1,p-2]$
- Compute $r=g^k\text{ mod }p$
- Compute $e=hash(r||m)$
- Compute $s=k-ea \text{ mod }(p-1)$
- Send $(s,e)$ along with $m$.

#verification of signature $(s,e)$ on $m$ with Alice's public key $A$:
- Compute $r'=g^sA^{e}\text{ mod }p$
- Compute $e' = hash(r'||m)$
- Check whether $e'=e$

It is different than #ElGamal as here, $e$ is computed with $m$ and $r$.

##### Security of Schnorr Signature
$k$ **must be different for each signature**.
If the $k$ is reused for two different signatures, then it is possible to retrieve the secret key $a$.
	$s_{1} = k_{1}-e_{1}a$ and $s_{2}=k_{2}-e_{2}a$ with $k_{1}=k_{2}=k$
	$\to s_{1}-s_{2}=a(e_{2}-e_{1})$
	$\to$ $a = (e_{1}-e_{2})^{-1}(s_{2}-s_{1}) \text{ mod }q$
And thus we retrieve the private key $a$.
	Note that the annoying case where $e_{1}=e_{2}$ which is really rare as the hashing scheme is supposed to **collision resistant**.

The #DLP is not easy to solve but let's take a look at how to solve it.
### 4.5.1 Solving DLP generically: baby-step giant-step
![](Pasted%20image%2020231224154717.png)
The **baby steps** is to compute and store all exponential values of $g$.

The **giant steps** is to compute $Ag^{-jm}$ and compare it with the previously stored values.

$\implies$ This takes a complexity of $O(\sqrt{ N })$ in **time and memory**
##### In group notation

$\implies$ This takes a complexity of $O(\sqrt{ N })$ in **time and memory**
### 4.5.2 Pohlig-Hellman
Let the size of the group be decomposed in prime factors:$$N=|G|=\Pi_{i}p_{i}^{e_{i}}$$Then we can solve the #DLP in time$$O\left(\Sigma_{i}e_{i}(\log N+\sqrt{ p_{i} })\right)$$
### 4.5.3 Conclusions
In conclusion, for the #DLP to be hard to break. The following conditions are **necessary** (but **not sufficient**):
- The **size of the group should be** $≈2^{2s}$ for security strength $s$.
- The size of the group should be prime.

Note: we focus on the actual group used. In the case of DSA, it is the sub-group of size q generated by f.
# 4.6 Elliptic curve cryptography
Given constants $a$ and $b$, an #elliptic-curve #EC is the **set of points** $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ that **satisfy the Weierstrass equation**:$$y^2=x^{3}+ax+b$$ together with the **point at infinity** denoted $O$ (one can view the point at infinity as $()0, \pm \infty)$).

An important #property of the #EC:
	**If a straight line meets an elliptic curve in two points, then it must cross a third point.**
		A point on a tangent counts for 2
		Don't forget $O$.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231224162319.png)
## 4.6.1 Group law
In #group law, let's build a **rule to add points on the curve**.
- Three aligned points must sum to $O$
- The point at infinity $O$ is the neutral element.
So:
- If $P$ and $P'$ are each other’s reflections over the x axis, then $P, P', O$ are aligned. So $P + P′ + O = O$ and $−P = P'$.
- If $P, Q, R$ are aligned, then $P + Q + R = O$ and $P + Q = −R$.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240122221512.png)
We talk about **order** of a point:
- $ord(P)=1 \iff$ It is the neutral element (infinity)
- $ord(P) = 2 \iff$ Has a vertical tangent
#TP4-2-ex13 
## 4.6.2 Elliptic curves over (prime) finite fields
Fix a #prime $p\geq 3$ and constants $a$ and $b$. An #EC is the set of points $(x,y)\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}^2$ that satisfy the Weierstrass equation $$y^2=x^{3}+ax+b$$ together with the point at infinity denoted $O$.

**Fact**: the *formulas for point addition and doubling also work here*.
We can thus define a finite group comprising the points on the curve (including O, the neutral element), together with the point addition as operation.
### 4.6.2.1 Number of points in a curve over a finite field
The **number of points on a curve** $E$ is denoted $\#E$. This number depends on the parameters $a$ and $b$.

### 4.6.2.2 To find points in a curve over a finite field
![](Pasted%20image%2020240122221306.png)
## 4.6.3 Projective coordinates
Instead of representing points on the curve with $(x,y)$ called *affine coordinates*, one can use an alternative representation using **three coordinates** called **projective coordinates**: $(X:Y:Z)$. They are mostly used for their **efficiency** as the operations on the points can be expressed without inversions. #TP4-2-ex16

When $Z \neq 0$, a **point in projective coordinates $(X:Y:Z)$ represent $(x,y)$ in affine coordinates** with:
- $x=XZ^{-1}$
- $y = YZ^{-1}$

For any $\lambda \neq 0$, the projective coordinates $(X:Y:Z)$ and $(\lambda X:\lambda Y:\lambda Z)$ represents the same point.

The #Weierstrass equation becomes$$Y^{2}Z=X^{3}+aXZ^{2}+bZ^{3}$$
The **point at infinity** $O$ in **projective coordinates** can be represented by all points where $Z=0$ and satisfies the Weierstrass equation $\to (0:Y:0)$ with $Y \neq 0$.
