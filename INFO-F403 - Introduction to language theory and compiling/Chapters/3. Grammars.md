#grammar are the tool used to specify the full syntax of a programming language.
## 3.1 Limits of regular languages
Let's show that not all #language are #regular with the example of $L_{()}$. The idea is to prove that we can form a loop in a part of the word and therefore the automaton would accept a word that does not belong to the language. Thus, the language $L_{()}$ is not regular. [Details here](info-f-403.pdf#page=73).

To help determine and to have a powerful formalism for *specifying* languages, we use #grammar.

A #grammar is a list of expressions/rules in the form of $\alpha \to \beta$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are strings of symbols. It *means* that the string $\alpha$ is replaced by $\beta$. 

For example: the **rule** $Ab \to Bc$ on the *string* $aAbBc$ can be *rewritten* $aBcBc$.

We can set up a set of *rewriting rules* to generate any syntactically correct grammar by creating **intermediary symbols** called #variable. In the case below, the only #variable is the Exp. The #terminals are the symbols: $+,*,(,),Id, Cst$.

Thanks to these rules, we can **derive** any expression needed to create a string of symbols.
## 3.2 Syntax and semantics
#syntax A #grammar is a quadruplet $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ where:
- $V$ is a set of #variable 
- $T$ is a set of #terminals 
- $P$ is a finite set of *production rules* of the form $\alpha\to\beta$ with:
	- $\alpha \in(V\cup T)^{*}V(V\cup T)^{*}$
	- $\beta\in(V\cup T)^{*}$
- $S\in V$ is a variable called the *start symbol*
There are various [examples](info-f-403.pdf#page=76).

#semantic Let $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ be a #grammar, and let $\gamma$ be such that $\gamma \in(V\cup T)^{*}V(V\cup T)^{*}$, and $\delta\in(V\cup T)^{*}$. Then, we say that $\delta$ *can be derived from* $\gamma$ (under the rules of G), written: $$\gamma \implies_{G}\delta$$ iff there are $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}\in (V\cup T)^{*}$ and a rule $\alpha\to\beta\in P$ such that $\gamma=\gamma_{1}\alpha\gamma_{2}$ and $\delta = \gamma_{1}\beta\gamma_{2}$.

Let $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ be a grammar. A **sentential form** is a word from$(V\cup T)^{*}$ that can be derived from the start symbol. Formally: $γ ∈ (V ∪T )^{*}$ is a #sentential-form (of G) iff$S \implies_{G}^{*} \gamma$.

Let $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ be a grammar. The **language of G** is: $$L(G)=\{w\in T^{*}|S \implies_{G}^{*}w\}$$
## 3.3 The Chomsky hierarchy
The #Chomsky **hierarchy** is made up of 4 classes of #grammar, defined according to syntactic criteria:
- **Class 0**: Unrestricted grammars, all grammars are in this class.
- **Class 1**: *Context-sensitive* grammars
	- A grammar $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ is #context-sensitive iff each rule $α→β ∈ P$ is such that
		- Either $\alpha=S$ and $\beta=\epsilon$;
		- Or $|\alpha| \leq |\beta|$ and $S$ does not appear in $\beta$.
- **Class 2**: *Context-free* grammars
	- A grammar $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ is #context-free iff each rule $α→β ∈ P$ is such that: $\alpha \in V$
		- For example, *if the left-hand side is only one variable*.
- **Class 3**: *Regular grammars*
	- A grammar $G = 〈V ,T ,P,S〉$ is #regular iff it is **either** left-regular or right-regular
		- G is #left-regular iff each rule $α→β ∈ P$ is s.t. $α ∈ V$ and either $β ∈ T^{∗}$ , or $β ∈ VT^{∗}$.
		- G is #right-regular iff each rule $α→β ∈ P$ is s.t. $α ∈ V$ and either $β ∈ T^{∗}$ , or $β ∈ T^{∗}V$.

#CFL A #language L is #context-free iff there exists a context-free grammar such that $L(G)=L$
#CSL A #language L is #context-sensitive iff there exists a context-sensitive grammar such that $L(G)=L$.
#RE A #language L is #recursively-enumerable iff there is a grammar such that $L(G)=L$
#### Theorem Chomsky
$$L^{3}=Reg ⊊ L^{2}= CFL ⊊ L^{1} = CSL ⊊ L^{0} = RE$$
1. $L^{3}=Reg$ : Each DFA can be converted into a grammar $G_{A}$ such that $L(A)=L(G_{A})$. [info-f-403](info-f-403.pdf#page=80)
2. $L^{2}=CFL$ : By definition.
3. $Reg ⊊ L^2$ : Assume the inverse, and observe that if every regular grammars is also context-free. Then $L^{3}⊆ L^{2}\to Reg ⊆ L^2$ and we can find a language which is CFL but not regular (such as $L_{()}$).
4. $L^{1}= CSL$: By definition.
5. $CFL ⊊ L^1$ : Show that all #context-free languages are also #context-sensitive ( #CFL are #CSL). But the **problem** is that *not all context-free* #grammar are *context-sensitive*.
	1. Observe that, in a context-free grammar, a rule of the form $α→β$ that violates the property$|α| ≤|β|$ is necessarily a rule of the form $A→ε$. 
	2. Because in CFG, *all left-hand sides of rules contain only one variable*: Thus $|α| = 1$ in all rule $α→β$ and so, $|α| > |β|$ means $|β|= 0$, hence $β = ε$.
	3. Based on this, compose a technique to turn every CFG into an **equivalent** CFG without rules of the form $A\to\epsilon$, except when $A$ is the start symbol.
		- Remove the rule $A\to\epsilon$ from $P$ :$$P' = P \backslash \{A \to\epsilon\}
$$
		- Find in $P'$ all the rules of the form $B →β$ where $β$ contains $A$, and, for each of those rules, add to $P'$ ′ all the rule $B →β'$, where $β'$ has been obtained by removing all the $A$ symbols from $β$:$$
		P'' = P' \cup\{B\to\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots\beta_{n}|B\to\beta_{1}A\beta_{2}A\dots A\beta_{n}\in P' \text{ with }\beta_{i} \in (T\cup V\backslash\{A\})^{*}\text{ for all i}\}
$$
	4. This yields a new grammar $G'=〈V ,T ,P'',S〉$ that preserves the same language. We can *operate this process until we don't have any rules of the type* $A\to\epsilon$ *anymore* with $A\neq S$. This gives us a resulting grammar $\overline{G}$.
	5. Now we need to get rid of all the S in the right-hand side of the rules (condition of #context-sensitive grammar). We do this with a transformation that preserve the language of the grammar:
		- Add a new variable $S'$ to the grammar: $V' = V \cup\{S'\}$
		- For each rule $S\to\beta$ with $\beta\neq\epsilon$, add to the grammar the rule $S'\to\beta$ $$P'=P\cup \{A\to\beta|S\to \beta\in P \text{ with }\beta\neq\epsilon\}$$
		- If the rule $S\to\epsilon$ exists in the grammar, make a copy of all $A\to\beta$ where $\beta$ contains $S$, replacing all $S$ by $\epsilon$.$$P''=P'\cup\{A\to\beta_{1}S'\beta_{2}S'\dots S'\beta_{n}|A\to\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots\beta_{n} \in P' \text{ with }\beta_{i} \in (T\cup V\backslash\{S\})^{*}\}$$
		- Finally replace all occurrences of S by $S'$ in right-hand sides of rules.$$P'''=\{A\to\beta_{1}S'\beta_{2}S'\dots S'\beta_{n}|A\to\beta_{1}S\beta_{2}S\dots S\beta_{n} \in P'' \text{ with }\beta_{i} \in (T\cup V\backslash\{S\})^{*}\}$$
	6. This shows that $CFL⊆L^1$. To prove that the inclusion is strict, we need to exhibit a language wish is #context-sensitive but not #context-free. 
6. $L^{0}= RE$ : By definitions.
7. $CSL⊊ L^0$ : The opposite holds by definition because all grammars belong to Class 0.
