## 2.1 Regular languages
The #definition of **regular languages** is recursive. It starts from the most simple languages and uses the +, . and * operations to build more complex ones.

#regular #regular-language
With the alphabet $\Sigma$, language $L$ is regular iff:
1. either $L = \phi$
2. or $L = \epsilon$
3. or $L = \{a\}$ for some $a \in \Sigma$
4. or $L = L_{1}  ∪ L_{2}$
5. or $L = L_{1} . L_{2}$
6. or $L = L_{1}^*$

The 3 first are the base conditions and the 3 lasts can be deduced from the firsts.
#### Demonstration
#demo
With $\Sigma =  \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$, the language $L = \{abc, def\}$ is regular:
$$ \text{Rule 3} \iff  \{a\} \{b\} \{c\} \{d\} \{e\} \{f\}$$
$$\text{Rule 5} \iff \{abc\} \text{  } \{def\}$$
$$\text{Rule 4} \iff \{abc,def\} \text{ is regular}$$
#### Consequences and observations
**Any finite language is regular**, because it can be obtained by concatenation: $$L = \{w_{1}\dots w_{n}\} = \{w_{1}\} ∪ \dots ∪ \{w_{n}\}$$
We note $\Sigma^*$ a **regular language** which is **infinite**.

But $L \subseteq \Sigma^{*} \nRightarrow$ L is regular.

The language $L_{()}$ is not regular because $L_{()}^{*} \neq L_{()}$
## 2.2 Regular expressions
#regular #regular-expression
Given the alphabet $\Sigma$, the following are **regular expressions** (3 first are base and rest can be deduce).

**Each regular expression represents a regular language and each regular language can be represented by a regular expression.**
## 2.3 Finite automata
Examples and complete information over the #finite #automata in the [syllabus](info-f-403.pdf#page=36).
[Slides](Slides220923.pdf).

The objective of a **finite automata** is to be able to *obtain* *for all regular languages*, some kind of *abstract specification of an algorithm* that allow us to *answer* the #membership-problem. Such an abstract model of algorithm is given by the notion of finite automata.
### 2.3.1 Intuition
A finite automaton is an abstract machine with the followings features:
- The machine reads a word letter by letter from the first to the last.  #reading 
	- This is done by putting the input in an **input tape** that the machine reads cell by cell thanks to a **reading head**. 
	- Each cell contains a letter of the input. 
	- Once the machine has read a letter, the reading head moves to the next cell. 
	- The machine can not be rewound.
- At **all times**, the machine is in a well-defined **discrete state**. #state
	- There are only *finitely many such states*. 
	- The *reading* of *each letter* triggers a *state change*.
- The **aim** of the machine is to **discriminate** between **words** that are **in a given language** or not.
	- The automaton does so by either accepting or rejecting input words (thanks to a binary output - yes/no).
#### Illustration
In this picture, we have an illustration of a finite automaton. But we need to indicate a few things:
- The state in which the automaton starts.
	- Here it is $q_{1}$
- How is the output of the automaton determined at all times.
	- Depends on the current state, when it is a **double border, it's a yes**.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925151724.png)
The automaton also define a language which contains all the words the automaton accepts. See [here the example](info-f-403.pdf#page=37).
### 2.3.2 Syntax
A **finite automaton** is a tuple: #definition #finite-automaton
$$A = \langle Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F \rangle$$
where:
- $Q$ is a finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ is the (finite) input alphabet
- $\delta : Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}) \mapsto 2^Q$ is the transition function
- $q_{0} \in Q$ is the initial state
- $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states.
#### Non-determinism
**Non determinism** is when there are multiple executions of the automaton possible on an input word. #non-determinism
![](Pasted%20image%2020230925154537.png)
In this example, the word ab can be accessed from 2 different ways ($q_{0} \to q_{1} \to q_{3}$ or $q_{0} \to q_{2} \to q_{4}$). And here we see that the output is different depending on the way used! The **rule** is that in non-deterministic automata, **there must exist one run that accepts for the word to be accepted**.

We will see later that all non-deterministic automata can be converted into an equivalent deterministic automaton.
#### Spontaneous move
#spontaneous #move #transition
A **spontaneous move** is a transition between two state that is labeled with the empty word $\epsilon$. It allows the automaton to change its current state without reading any character on the input (without moving the reading head).

It is useful for example if we want to have an automaton for a language where all words begins by a combination of a's and ends with a combination of b's (possibly empty). If we create two automatons, one for the a's and one for the b's. We can link them with a spontaneous move and have the final automaton. #example

### 2.3.3 Classes of automata
#definition 
A **non-deterministic finite state automata with $\epsilon$-transitions** #epsilon-NFA is a finite state automaton, as defined in 2.3.

A **non-deterministic finite state automaton** #NFA is an $\epsilon$-NFA $A = \langle Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F \rangle$ s.t. for all $q \in Q: \delta(q,\epsilon) = \phi$. In this case, we will henceforth assume that the signature of the transition function is $\delta:Q \times \Sigma \mapsto 2^Q$.

A **deterministic finite state automaton** #DFA is an NFA  $A = \langle Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F \rangle$ s.t. for all $q \in Q$, for all $a \in \Sigma:|\delta(q,a)|=1$. In this case, we will henceforth assume that the signature of the transition function is $δ : Q \times \Sigma \mapsto Q$, and that the function is *complete*.
### 2.3.4 Semantics
Goes beyond the classes domain but interesting. See [here](info-f-403.pdf#page=40).
## 2.4 Equivalence between automata and regular expressions
Slides are [here](Slides260923.pdf). #slides

We already know that regular expressions define exactly the class of regular languages but what about the expressive power of the 3 different classes of automata. Obviously, #DFA can not be more expressive than #NFA which can not be more expressive than #epsilon-NFA.

The **expressive power of all three classes** of finite au- tomata **is exactly the same**, and **equals** that **of regular expressions**, that is, the regular languages. This is proven by #Kleene 's theorem.
### Kleene's theorem
#Kleene #theorem
For every regular language $L$, there is a DFA $A$ such that $L(A) = L$. Conversely, for all $\epsilon$-NFAs $A$, $L(A)$ is regular.

$\to$ In other words, all finite automata recognise regular languages and all regular languages are recognised by a finite automaton. We will demonstrate that by showing that we can go from each type of automaton to each other type and also regular expressions (as on the schema below).
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927110058.png)
### 2.4.1 From regular expressions to $\epsilon$-NFA
To turn a regular expression into a FA, we will once again exploit the recursive definition of the syntax of regular expressions. 

The general idea is to build for all **regular expressions** $r$ an #epsilon-NFA $A_{r}$ where:
- $L(A_{r}) = L(r)$
- The initial state of $A_{r}$ is called $q_{r}^i$, and $A_{r}$ has exactly one final state of $A_{r}$ which is $q_{r}^f$.
	- No transition enter  $q_{r}^i$, nor leave $q_{r}^f$.

We will start with the **base cases** of the regular expression definition (see 2.2).
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927113124.png)
Then the **inductive cases**. For those, we assume $\epsilon$-NFAs $A_{r_{1}}$ and $A_{r_{2}}$ are already known for two regular expressions $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$. We treat the *disjunction*, *concatenation* and *Kleene closure* as follows.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927113451.png)
#### Example
For the regular expression:
$$l . (l+d)^*$$
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927114310.png)
[Details](info-f-403.pdf#page=43).
### 2.4.2 From $\epsilon$-NFAs to DFAs
Intuitively, the #DFA $D$ corresponding to a given #epsilon-NFA $A$ will *simulate* all the possible executions of $A$ on a given input word, buy tracking the possible states in which $A$ can be at all times.

In order to do so, the DFA needs some type of memory. They use the states of the DFA to encode the memory. Therefore, the states of the DFA $D$ will be *subsets* of $A$'s set if states.

Here, let's build a DFA that stimulates all possible runs of the $\epsilon$-NFA "in parallel".
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927115014.png)
This automaton ($\epsilon$-NFA) $A$ on the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ can have several runs on the same word ($w= a$).
- $q_{0} \to q_{1}$ or $q_{0} \to q_{2} \to q_{3}$

The **states of the DFA $B$** (below in red) are *sets of states of the $\epsilon$-NFA*.
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927115259.png)
- Note that here, the accepting state/ #sets are in a double rectangle.

For each path in $A$, there is an "**equivalent**" path in $B$.
- $q_{0} \to q_{1} \to q_{1}$ in $A$
- $\{q_{0},q_{1}\} \to \{q_{1}, q_{3}\} \to \{q_{1}\}$ in $B$
Which means that : $L(A) \subseteq L(B)$.

And for each path in $B$, there is an "**equivalent**" path in $A$.
- $\{q_{0},q_{2}\} \to \{q_{1}, q_{3}\} \to \{q_{4}\}$ in $B$
- $q_{0} \to q_{2} \to q_{4}$ in $A$.
Which means that $L(B) \subseteq L(A)$ and thus $\implies L(A) = L(B)$. #enddemo
#### Determinisation of  $\epsilon$-NFAs
![](Pasted%20image%2020230927120519.png)
Note the the #epsilon-closure of a state $q$ is the set of all states reachable from $q$ by reading $\epsilon$. #definition See [definition here](info-f-403.pdf#page=45).

#### Size of the determinated automaton
We can sometimes have **more states than we need**, with states that are not reachable for example. We can thus **avoid their construction**. But it is not always the case, therefore we need to be able to determine the number of states per automaton.

For an *infinite language* $L_{n}$:
- For all $n\geq 1$, there is an **$\epsilon$-NFA** $A_{n}$ that recognises $L_{n}$ and the **size** of the $A_{n}$ **grow linearly with $n$**
- Letting $D_{n}$ be any **deterministic automaton** recognising $L_{n}$, which **size** **grows exponentially with $n$**.

[Demonstration of the size of determinated automaton](info-f-403.pdf#page=49).
### 2.4.3 From $\epsilon$-NFAs to regular expressions
[Slides031023](Slides031023.pdf).
#State-elimination-technique
The following technique to go from a #epsilon-NFA to a #regular-expression is the **state elimination technique**. It consists in *eliminating states of the original* $\epsilon$-NFA one by one and *updating the labels* of the remaining transitions to make sure that the accepted language does not change.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231009113246.png)
#### Assumptions and general idea
Hypothesises:
1. **All transitions are labeled** by a #regular-expression $r_{i,j}$ 
2. We assume **there is a transition between each pair of states** $(p_{i},s_{j})$;
	- If not, we can always add transitions that are labeled by the regular expression $\phi$ without modifying the accepted language of the automaton.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231009113715.png)
Here we can see that when we **delete the state q**, we add all the paths that went through q to the other transitions with a **+** (or).
#### Algorithm
Once the states deleted, the algorithm to convert an $\epsilon$-NFA into a regular expression accepting the same language is as follows.

#algorithm #epsilon-NFA $\to$ #regular-expression 
For each accepting state $q_{f} \in F$, we build an equivalent automaton $A_{q_{f}}$ by *deleting all states except* $q_{0}$ *and* $q_{f}$ *from A*. 

Since all the states between $q_{0}$ and $q_{f}$ have been removed, $A_{q_{f}}$ is necessarily of either forms shown here below. Only $q_{0}$ and $q_{f}$ are left and it could be the case that $q_{0}=q_{f}$. In both cases, computing the regular expression that corresponds to those automata is easy.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231009114855.png)
So, for all accepting state $q_{f}$, we can now compute a regular expression $r_{q_{f}}$ that **accept all the words *A* accepts by a run ending in*** $q_{f}$.

$\to$ The language of $A$ is exactly the set of all words that $A$ accepts by a run ending in either of the accepting states. If all the accepting states of $A$ is $F = \{q_{f}^{1},q_{f}^{2}\dots,q_{f}^n\}$ , we obtain the regular expression corresponding to $A$ as:
$$q_{f}^{1}+q_{f}^{2}+\dots+q_{f}^n$$

[Sylla if wanted](info-f-403.pdf#page=55).
## 2.6 Operations on regular languages
### 2.6.1 Union
#Union
Given two languages $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ we compute $A$ such that:
$$L(A) = L(A_{1}) \cup L(A_{2})$$
![](Pasted%20image%2020231009133322.png)
### 2.6.2 Complement
#Complement
Given a $\epsilon$-NFA $A$, we want to compute a $\epsilon$-NFA $\overline{A}$ such that$$L(\overline{A}) = \overline{L(A)} = \Sigma^{*} \text{ except }L(A)$$
#### First idea
The first idea would be to replace all the accepting state by non-accepting states and vice-versa. But **it doesn't work on** #epsilon-NFA and #NFA!

Indeed, here the automaton accepts $a^*$, so the **complement** of the language is $\Sigma^{*} \text{ except } a^{*} = \phi$. But if we take the automaton obtained by only accepting $q_{2}$ as an accepting state accepts $a^{+}\neq \phi$.
$\to$ The problem comes from **non-determinism**!
#### Solution
For a #DFA, swapping accepting and non-accepting states of a DFA A, and keeping the rest of the automaton identical yields an automaton $\overline{A}$ accepting the complement of A’s language. On each word $w$, the sequence of states traversed by $\overline{A}$ will be the same as in $A$. Only the final state will be accepting in $\overline{A}$ iff it is rejecting in A.
![](Pasted%20image%2020231009135401.png)
If the given automaton is **not deterministic**, we **need to determinise it** by using the procedure of section 2.4.2.
### 2.6.3 Intersection
Given two languages $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, #intersection is a computation such that$$L(B)=L(A_{1}) \cap L(A_{2})$$![](Pasted%20image%2020231010080619.png)
### 2.6.4 Language inclusion
Given twp languages $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, #inclusion check whether $$L(A_{1}) \subseteq  L(A_{2})$$
This means that all behaviour of some system $A_{1}$ respect the property of all the good behaviours of $A_{2}$.

Note that:
iff $L(A_{1}) \cap \overline{L(A_{2})}=\phi$ , then $L(A_{1}) \subseteq  L(A_{2})$
