#Parsing is the second step of the compiling process, it consists of the **analysis of the syntax of the input program to check its correctness**. In this chapter, we will see the #top-down-parser.

A **top-down parser** parser tries and *build a derivation tree for the input string* starting from the root, *applying the grammar rules one after the other*, until *the sequence of tree leaves forms the desired string*.
## 5.1 Principle of top-down parsing
A #PDA that accepts the language of operations is the following:![](Pasted%20image%2020231026145007.png)It simulates the **leftmost derivation** by maintaining at all times on its stack, a suffix of the #sentential-form. (Example for Id+Id * Id)![](Pasted%20image%2020231026145241.png)The PDA will start its execution to go from to:![](Pasted%20image%2020231026145543.png)
### Systematic construction of a top down parser
#formalisation
Let's build a #PDA that accepts by #empty-stack the language of a given #CFG.

Let $G = 〈V , T , P , S〉$ a CFG, let's build the PDA $P_{G}= 〈{q}, T ,V ∪ T , δ, q, S,\phi〉$ where $\delta$ is such that:
1. For all symbols $A$ and all the rules from $A$, the PDA has a transition that **pops A and push** $\alpha$ instead. This operation is called a #produce (of rule $A\to\alpha$ ). $$ \text{For all }A ∈ V : δ(q, ε, A) = \{(q, α) | A → α ∈ P \}$$
2. For all terminals $a$ of the grammar, there is a transition that reads $a$ from the input and pops $a$ from the stack. This operation is called a #match.$$\text{For all } a∈ T : δ(q, a, a) = \{(q, ε)\}$$
3. In all other cases, $\delta(a,b,c)=\phi$.
### Non-determinism in the parser
#parser
This method **allows to derive a PDA from any CFG**, but it is **not a parser yet** due to **non-determinism**.
When a terminal is present on the top of the stack, the behaviour of the PDA is **deterministic** because it will **match** this symbol with the same symbol on the input.

Such #non-determinism can only occur when a produce must be performed with symbol $A$ on the top of the stack and when there are, in the original grammar, at least two rules $A → α_1$ and $A → α_2$ to choose from.

**Lift non-determinism** is the same as *knowing which rule to produce* if there is a certain symbol on the stack and multiple possible rules.
## 5.2 Predictive parser
The objective now is **to identify classes of grammars for which a deterministic parser can be achieved**. If we allow the parser to make use of some *extra information* called the #look-ahead.
It is parametrised by a natural number $k$ and consists of the $k$ **next characters on the input**. The parser can thus take those into account *without actually reading them* to help decide which transition to take.
$\to$ A #parser that make use of the #look-ahead are #predictive-parser.

### 5.2.1 PDA with look-ahead
A #k-LPDA or a #PDA with #look-ahead is the same as a classic PDA $〈Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q_{0}, Z_{0}, F〉$ but the transition function changes:
- $\delta : Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\})\times \Gamma \times\Sigma^{\leq k} \mapsto 2^{Q\times\Gamma^*}$ with $\Sigma^{\leq k} = \cup_{i=0}^{k}\Sigma^i$

#skip Pas vu en cours, mais intéressant quand même -> changement pour les #k-LPDA configurations etc.
## 5.3 First and Follow k
#Firstk $First^{k}(\alpha)=$ all prefixes of length k of words that can be generated from $\alpha$.
$$First^{k}(\alpha)=\{w\in T^{*}\mid\alpha\implies^{*}wx, \text{ either }|w|=k \text{ or }(|w|<k)\text{ and }x=\epsilon\}$$
#Followk
$$Follow^{k}(\alpha)=\{w \in T^{*}\mid \text{there are }\beta,\gamma \text{ }s.t.S\implies^{*}\beta\alpha\gamma \text{ and } w\in First^k(\alpha)\}$$

An example of the construction of an #action-table is available [info-f-403](info-f-403.pdf#page=138).
## 5.4 LL(k) grammars
Using the tools defined up here #Firstk and #Followk, we will now identify the classes of CFGs for which the predictive #parser using $k$ characters of #look-ahead will be deterministic. Those grammars are called #LLk grammars. Where LL comes from:
- **Left Scanning** - Because the *input string is read from left to the right*.
- **Left Parsing** - the **parser** builds a *leftmost derivation* when successfully recognising the input word.

**A grammar is** #LLk **iff it can be parsed deterministically by a top-down parser using the $k$ symbols of look-ahead**.

Let's see what are the **conditions on the derivations** of the grammar to assure to have a deterministic parser when it has access to $k$ characters of look-ahead.

The only **source of non-determinism** is when we have two rules: $A\to\alpha_{1}$ and $A\to\alpha_{2}$. Because the *parser does not know which rule to use*. And the $k$ look-ahead does not help to determine the rules to use.![](Pasted%20image%2020231109093624.png) When the #parser is at the step where $A$ is on the top of the #stack. The parser must decide, and he sees the look-ahead of $First^{k}(x_{1})$ and $First^{k}(x_{2})$ that are (depending on $k$) different and allows to help the parser decide.

The definition of #LLk grammar is based on this intuition. If the $First^{k}(x_{1}) = First^{k}(x_{2})$, then $\alpha_{1} = \alpha_{2}$ and thus there is no choice to be made in the grammar. Otherwise, the parser could not take a decision and the grammar would not be LL(k).

---
#definition #LLk 
A #CFG $〈P , T ,V , S〉$ is LL(k) iff for all pairs of derivations:
$$S \implies^{*}wA\gamma \implies w\alpha_{1}\gamma\implies^{*}wx_{1}$$$$S \implies^{*}wA\gamma \implies w\alpha_{2}\gamma\implies^{*}wx_{2}$$with $w, x_{1}, x_{2}\in T^{*}, A\in V$ and $\gamma \in (V \cup T)^{*}$ and $First^{k}(x_{1}) = First^{k}(x_{2})$, we have $\alpha_{1} = \alpha_{2}$.

### 5.4.1 Strong LL(k) grammars
A **Strong LL(k) grammar** rely on a **syntactic condition** instead of a *semantic condition*. It concerns **only the rules of the grammars** and allows us to derive a practical test to check whether a grammar is #LLk.
****
#definition 
A #CFG $G =〈P , T ,V , S〉$ is #Strong-LLk iff for all pairs of rules $A\to\alpha_{1}$ and $A\to\alpha_{2}$ in $P$ (with $\alpha_{1}\neq\alpha_{2}$):$$First^k(\alpha_1 Follow^k(A))\cap First^k(\alpha_2 Follow^k(A))=\phi$$This syntactic definition is way easier to use and manipulate.
*****
A #theorem is really cool because it helps us determine that some grammars are LL(k):
1. For all $k \geq 1$, for all CFG: if G is strong LL(k) then it is also LL(k);
2. For all $k \geq 2$, there is a CFG G which is LL(k) but not strong LL(k);
3. However, **all LL(1) grammars are also strong LL(1)**, i.e. the classes of LL(1) and strong LL(1) grammars coincide.
---
Some observations:
- $LL(h) \subseteq LL(h+1)$
- For all $h \geq 0$: a grammar that has left-recursion is not $LL(k)$.
## 5.5 LL(1) parser
### 5.5.1 Obtaining a LL(1) grammar
To have an LL(1) grammar, you need to avoid those obstacles: **ambiguity**, **left recursion**, **common prefixes**. #ambiguity #left-recursion #Factoring 
### 5.5.2 Action table
To ease the construction of the #top-down-parser, one must build an #action-table. It is a table which **describe what actions the parser must perform** (either #produce or #match) **depending on the look-ahead and the top of the stack**. We will describe the parser with look-ahead only with action tables (even if it acts like a #PDA).
***
#definition 
An #LL1 #action-table Let $G = 〈P , T ,V , S〉$ be a CFG. Let us assume that: 
1. G’s rules (elements of P ) are indexed from 1 to n; and
2. $P$ contains a rule of the form $S → α\$$, where $\$ ∈ T$ is a terminal that does not occur elsewhere in the grammar (it is an end-of-string marker) and this rule is the only one that has $S$ on the left-hand side.
Then, the LL(1)-action table of G is a two-dimensional table **M** s.t.:
- The **lines of M** are indexed by **elements from T ∪ V** (the *potential tops of stack*);
- The **rows of M** are indexed by elements from T (the *potential look-aheads*); and 
- **Each cell M** $[α, ℓ]$ contains a **set of actions** that the parser must perform in configurations where $α$ is **the symbol on the top of the stack**, and $ℓ$ is the **next terminal on the input**. These **actions** can be either: 
	- **An integer** $i$ s.t. 1 ≤ i ≤ n, denoting that a produce of rule number i must be performed (i.e., if rule number i is α → β, then pop α from the stack and push β); or
	- **Accept**, denoting that the string read so far is accepted. This occurs only in cell $M [\$, \$]$, i.e., when $ is on the top of the stack and also the next symbol on the input. In terms of PDA, this consists in reading $, and popping it, to reach an accepting configuration (provided that no characters are left on the input); #accept
	- **Match**, denoting that a match action must be performed. This action occurs only in the cases where $α = ℓ ∈ T$ . Then, the action consists in popping α and reading α from the input. #match
	- **Error**, denoting the fact that the parser has discovered an error and cannot go on with the construction of a derivation. The input should be rejected.
